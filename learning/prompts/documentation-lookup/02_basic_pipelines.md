Prompt:
What is a Pipeline in Apache Beam?
Response:
In Apache Beam, a [pipeline](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/pipelines/design-your-pipeline/) encapsulates the entirety of a data processing task, including all the data and each step of the process. Essentially, it's a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of transformations (known as `PTransform`) applied to data collections (`PCollection`).

The simplest pipelines in Apache Beam follow a linear flow of operations, typically adhering to a read-process-write pattern. However, pipelines can also be significantly more complex, featuring multiple input sources, output sinks, and operations (known as a `PTransform`) that can both read from and output to multiple PCollections.
For more information about pipeline design and best practices, see [Common Pipeline Patterns](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/patterns/overview/).

To use Beam, your driver program must first create an instance of the Beam SDK class `Pipeline` (typically in the `main()` function).

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
  pass  # Build your pipeline here.
```

When you create your pipeline, you need to set [configuration options](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#configuring-pipeline-options). You can set your pipeline’s configuration options programmatically. You can also set the options ahead of time, or read them from the command line, and then pass them to the `Pipeline` object when you create the object. This option is often easier than setting the pipeline configuration options programmatically.
