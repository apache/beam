Prompt:
What are additional outputs in Apache Beam?

Response:
In Apache Beam, additional outputs, also known as tagged or side outputs, refer to one or multiple extra ['PCollection’s](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/basics/#pcollection) produced by a single ['ParDo'](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pardo) transform in addition to the main output ‘PCollection’. The ‘ParDo’ transform has the flexibility to produce any number of additional output ‘PCollection’s and return them bundled together with the main output ‘PCollection’.

Additional outputs serve as a mechanism to implement branching in a pipeline. You can use them when there is a need to split the output of a single transform into several ‘PCollections’ or produce outputs in different formats. Additional outputs become particularly beneficial when a transform’s computation per element is time-consuming because they enable transforms to process each element in the input ‘PCollection’ just once. For example, if a pipeline requires reading first names from a database table and extracting names that start with the letters ‘A’ and ‘B’, leveraging additional outputs allows for a more efficient approach. Instead of implementing two transforms that process the elements in the same input ‘PCollection’ with different logic, additional outputs enable applying one transform that processes each element once and outputs two collections. This approach avoids processing each element in the input ‘PCollection’ twice.

In the Apache Beam Java SDK, you can implement additional outputs by creating a ‘TupleTag’ object to identify each collection produced by the ‘ParDo’ transform. After specifying the ‘TupleTag’s for each of the outputs, the tags are passed to the ‘ParDo’ using the ‘.withOutputTags’ method. You can find a sample Apache Beam Java pipeline that applies one transform to output two ‘PCollections’ in [Branching ‘PCollections’](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/pipelines/design-your-pipeline/#a-single-transform-that-produces-multiple-outputs) in the Beam documentation.

In the Apache Beam Python SDK, you can implement additional outputs by invoking the ‘with_outputs()’ method on the ‘ParDo’ and specifying the expected tags for the multiple outputs. The method returns a ‘DoOutputsTuple’ object, with the specified tags serving as attributes that provide ‘ParDo’ with access to the corresponding output ‘PCollection’s. For a sample Apache Beam Python pipeline demonstrating a word count example with multiple outputs, refer to the [multiple output ‘ParDo’](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/cookbook/multiple_output_pardo.py) example in the Apache Beam GitHub repository.
