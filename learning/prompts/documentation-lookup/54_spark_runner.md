Prompt: How to execute Apache Beam pipelines with Apache Spark?

Response:
Apache Beam supports multiple runners for executing pipelines on various platforms. One such runner is the [Spark Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/spark/), tailored for running pipelines using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). The Spark Runner enables you to leverage the scalability and parallel processing capabilities of Apache Spark for your data processing tasks.

Key features of the Spark Runner include:
* Support for batch, streaming, and unified pipelines.
* Offering the same [fault-tolerance guarantees](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#fault-tolerance-semantics) and [security features](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/security.html) as provided by Apache Spark.
* Built-in metrics reporting using Apache Spark’s [metrics system](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics), which also reports Beam Aggregators.
* Native support for Apache Beam side inputs via Apache Spark’s [broadcast variables](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#broadcast-variables).

There are three types of Spark Runners available:
1. Legacy Spark Runner: supports Java (and other JVM-based languages) exclusively, based on Apache Spark’s [RDD and DStream](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.html).
2. Structured Streaming Spark Runner: supports Java (and other JVM-based languages) exclusively, based on Apache Spark's [Datasets](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#datasets-and-dataframes) and [Structured Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) framework. Currently, it only supports batch mode with limited coverage of the Apache Beam model.
3. Portable Spark Runner: supports Java, Python, and Go.

For Java-based applications, consider using the Java-based runners, while for Python or Go pipelines, opt for the portable Runner.

The Spark Runner can execute Spark pipelines similar to a native Spark application, allowing deployment as a self-contained application for local mode, running on [Spark Standalone Resource Manager (RM)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html), or using [YARN](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-yarn.html) or [Mesos](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-mesos.html).

To execute your Apache Beam pipeline on a Spark Standalone RM, follow these steps:

***Java-based Non-portable Spark Runners (Java Only)***

***1. Specify Dependencies:***

In the `pom.xml` file of your Java project directory, specify your dependency on the latest version of the Spark Runner:

```java
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
  <artifactId>beam-runners-spark-3</artifactId>
  <version>2.54.0</version>
</dependency>
```

***2. Deploy Spark with Your Application:***

When running pipelines in a Spark Standalone mode, ensure that your self-contained application includes Spark dependencies explicitly in your `pom.xml` file:

```java
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
  <artifactId>spark-core_2.12</artifactId>
  <version>${spark.version}</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
  <artifactId>spark-streaming_2.12</artifactId>
  <version>${spark.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Shade the application JAR using the [Maven shade plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/) and make sure the shaded JAR file is visible in the target directory by running `is target`.

To run pipelines in a Spark Standalone mode using the legacy RDD/DStream-based Spark Runner, use the following command:

```java
spark-submit --class com.beam.examples.BeamPipeline --master spark://HOST:PORT target/beam-examples-1.0.0-shaded.jar --runner=SparkRunner
```

To run pipelines in a Spark Standalone mode using the Structured Streaming Spark Runner, run the following command:

```java
spark-submit --class com.beam.examples.BeamPipeline --master spark://HOST:PORT target/beam-examples-1.0.0-shaded.jar --runner=SparkStructuredStreamingRunner
```

***3. Configure Pipeline Options:***

Set the runner option in your pipeline options to specify that you want to use the Spark Runner. In Java, you can do this as follows:

```java
SparkPipelineOptions options = PipelineOptionsFactory.as(SparkPipelineOptions.class);
options.setRunner(SparkRunner.class);
```

For additional pipeline configuration options, refer to the [Pipeline Options for the Spark Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/spark/#pipeline-options-for-the-spark-runner) section in the Spark Runner documentation.

***4. Run Your Pipeline:***

In Java, you can use the `PipelineRunner` to run your pipeline:

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create(options);
// Add transforms to your pipeline
p.run();
```

***5. Monitor Your Job:***

Monitor the execution of your pipeline using the Apache Spark [Web Interfaces](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#web-interfaces), which provides information about tasks, stages, and overall progress. Access the Spark UI by navigating to the appropriate URL (usually `localhost:4040`). Metrics are also accessible via the Apache Beam [REST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api). Apache Spark offers a [metrics system](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics) for reporting metrics to various sinks.

***Portable Spark Runner (Python)***

***1. Deploy Spark with Your Application:***

You will need Docker installed in your execution environment. Pre-built Spark Job Service Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/beam_spark_job_server).

Start the JobService endpoint:

```python
docker run --net=host apache/beam_spark_job_server:latest
```
A Beam JobService is a central instance where you submit your Apache Beam pipeline. It needs to be provided with the Spark master address to create a job for execution on your Spark cluster.

Submit the Python pipeline to this endpoint, providing Beam JobService with the Spark master address to execute the job on a Spark cluster:

```python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions

options = PipelineOptions([
    "--runner=PortableRunner",
    "--job_endpoint=localhost:8099", ​​# localhost:8099 is the default address of the JobService
    "--environment_type=LOOPBACK"
])
with beam.Pipeline(options) as p:
    ...
```

***2. Configure Pipeline Options:***

Set the runner option in your pipeline options to specify that you want to use the Spark Runner. In Python, you can do this as follows:

```python
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions
options = PipelineOptions()
options.view_as(SparkRunnerOptions).runner = 'SparkRunner'
```

For additional pipeline configuration options, refer to the [Pipeline Options for the Spark Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/spark/#pipeline-options-for-the-spark-runner) section in the Spark Runner documentation.

***3. Run Your Pipeline:***

In Python, you can use the `run()` method of your pipeline object to execute the pipeline:

```python
    # Run your pipeline
    p.run()
```

***4. Monitor Your Job:***

You can monitor the execution of your pipeline using the Apache Spark [Web Interfaces](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#web-interfaces), which provides information about tasks, stages, and overall progress. Access the Spark UI by navigating to the appropriate URL (usually `localhost:4040`) in your web browser. Spark metrics are not yet supported on the portable runner.
