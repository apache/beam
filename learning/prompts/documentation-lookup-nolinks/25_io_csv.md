Prompt:
Is CSV format supported in Apache Beam?

Response:
CSV is a data format for storing and exchanging data. Apache Beam supports reading data from and writing data to CSV files using the `ReadFromText` and `WriteToText` transforms in the `TextIO` module. For more information, see the TextIO connector documentation for your programming language of choice.

To get started with CSV and Apache Beam, refer to the Dataflow Cookbook GitHub repository.

Here is an example of Apache Beam pipeline code for reading data from a CSV file:

```python
class CsvOptions(PipelineOptions):
    @classmethod
    def _add_argparse_args(cls, parser):
        parser.add_argument(
            "--file_path",
            default="gs://your-bucket/your-file.csv",
            help="Csv file path",
        )


options = CsvOptions()

with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
    output = (
        p
        | "Read from Csv file" >> ReadFromCsv(path=options.file_path)
        | "Log Data" >> Map(logging.info)
    )
```
