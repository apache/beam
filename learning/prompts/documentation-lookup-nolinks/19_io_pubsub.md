Prompt:
Is Pub/Sub supported in Apache Beam?

Response:
Pub/Sub is a Google Cloud service that provides a simple, reliable, scalable, and secure real-time messaging service for sending and receiving messages between independent applications. Apache Beam provides a PubSubIO connector that allows you to read and write messages from and to Pub/Sub. Pub/Sub is currently supported only in streaming pipelines.

Pub/Sub is supported natively in the Beam SDKs for Java, Python, and Go. It is also available in Typescript through X Language.

To get started with Pub/Sub and Apache Beam, the Dataflow Cookbook GitHub repository provides code examples for reading and writing data from and to Pub/Sub.

Here is an example of the Apache Beam pipeline code for reading data from a Pub/Sub topic and writing it to another topic:

```python
from apache_beam.io import ReadFromPubSub
from apache_beam.io import WriteToPubSub

with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
    (
        p
        | "Read from Pub/Sub" >> ReadFromPubSub(topic="input_topic")
        | "Write to Pub/Sub" >> WriteToPubSub(topic="output_topic")
    )
```
