# Partition

Partition is a Beam transform for PCollection objects that store the same data type.  Partition splits a single 
PCollection into a fixed number of smaller collections.

Partition divides the elements of a PCollection according to a partitioning function (PartitionFn) that you provide. A 
PartitionFn contains the logic that determines how to split up the elements of the input PCollection into
each resulting partition PCollection.

**Kata:** Provide a custom PartitionFn to 
[beam.Partition](https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#Partition)
that splits a PCollection of numbers into two PCollections.  The first PCollection contains numbers greater
than 100, and the second PCollection contains the remaining numbers.
