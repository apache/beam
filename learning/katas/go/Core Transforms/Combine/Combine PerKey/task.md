# CombinePerKey

After creating a keyed PCollection, a common pattern  is to combine the collection of values associated with 
each key into a single, merged value. The Go SDK inserts a GroupByKey and per-key Combine transform into the pipeline.

**Kata:** Implement the sum of scores per player using 
[beam.CombinePerKey](https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#CombinePerKey).
