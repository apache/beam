# Assigning Timestamps

A DoFn can assign timestamps to elements of a PCollection.  We will see the use these timestamps in the next lesson
on windowing.  A simple dataset in this lesson has five git commit messages and their timestamps from the
[Apache Beam public repository](https://github.com/apache/beam).

**Kata:** Assign a timestamp to PCollection&lt;Commit&gt; elements based on the datetime of the commit message.
