# Composite Transform

Transforms can have a nested structure, where a complex transform performs multiple simpler 
transforms (such as more than one ParDo, Combine, GroupByKey, or even other composite transforms). 
These transforms are called composite transforms. Nesting multiple transforms inside a single 
composite transform can make your code more modular and easier to understand.  Additionally, 
scopes may be augmented with custom naming for monitoring purposes.

**Kata:** This kata has two tasks.  One is to implement a composite transform that extracts characters 
from a list of strings, excludes any spaces and returns a PCollection of type KV<string, int>
associating a character with its count in the sample input.
Second is to create a sub-scope in the composite transform with the name "CountCharacters".

<div class="hint">
  Use <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#ParDo">
  beam.ParDo</a>
  with a <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#hdr-DoFns">
  DoFn</a> in your composite transform to extract non space characters from the input.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  You can use <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/transforms/stats/#Count">
  stats.Count</a>
  to count the number of appearances of each character in the PCollection&lt;string&gt; input.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Use the method <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#Scope.Scope">
  Scope</a> to create a sub-scope in the composite transform.
