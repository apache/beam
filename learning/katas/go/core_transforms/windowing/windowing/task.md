# Windowing

This lesson introduces the concept of windowed PCollection elements.  A window is a view into a fixed beginning and 
fixed end to a set of data.  In the beam model, windowing subdivides a PCollection according to the
timestamps of its individual elements.  An element can be a part of one or more windows.

A DoFn can request timestamp and windowing information about the element it is processing.  All the previous lessons 
had this information available as well.  This lesson makes use of these parameters.  The simple dataset 
has five git commit messages and their timestamps from the 
[Apache Beam public repository](https://github.com/apache/beam).  Timestamps have been applied to this PCollection
input according to the date and time of these messages.

**Kata:** This lesson challenges you to apply an hourly fixed window to a PCollection.  You are then to 
apply a ParDo to that hourly fixed windowed PCollection to produce a PCollection of a Commit struct.  The
Commit struct is provided for you.  You are encouraged to run the pipeline at cmd/main.go of this task 
to visualize the windowing and timestamps.

<div class="hint">
    Use <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#ParDo">
    beam.ParDo</a>
    with a <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#hdr-DoFns">
