# GroupByKey

GroupByKey is a Beam transform for processing collections of key/value pairs. Itâ€™s a parallel
reduction operation, analogous to the Shuffle phase of a Map/Shuffle/Reduce-style algorithm. The
input to GroupByKey is a collection of key/value pairs that represents a multimap, where the
collection contains multiple pairs that have the same key, but different values. Given such a
collection, you use GroupByKey to collect all of the values associated with each unique key.

**Kata:** Implement a

beam.GroupByKey</a> transform that groups words by its first letter.

  To return as a KV, you can return two values from your DoFn. The first return value represents the Key, and 
  the second return value represents the Value.  An example is shown below.
  
```
func doFn(element string) (string, string) {
    key := string(element[0])
    value := element
    return key, value
}
``` 
</div>
