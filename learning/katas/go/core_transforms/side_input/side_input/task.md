# Side Input

In addition to the main input PCollection, you can provide additional inputs to a ParDo transform 
in the form of side inputs. A side input is an additional input that your DoFn can access each time 
it processes an element in the input PCollection. When you specify a side input, you create a view 
of some other data that can be read from within the ParDo transformâ€™s DoFn while processing each 
element.

Side inputs are useful if your ParDo needs to inject additional data when processing each element 
in the input PCollection, but the additional data needs to be determined at runtime (and not 
hard-coded). Such values might be determined by the input data, or depend on a different branch of 
your pipeline.

**Kata:** Please enrich each Person with the country based on the city he/she lives in.

    A ParDo that has a PCollection KV as side input expects a DoFn that looks like the following.    
    
```
func doFn(element X, kvIterator func(*K, *V) bool, emit func(Y)) {
    // element of type X comes from your PCollection input
    // from your KV side input:     
    var key K   // expect a key of type K 
    var value V // expect a value of type V 
    for kvIterator(&key, &value) {
        // do something with key and value
        // emit(some result)
    }
} 
```
