# Testing in Apache Beam

Now that you have a simple pipeline up and running, let's talk about testing in Apache Beam using the Golang SDK.

Testing your pipeline is a particularly important step in developing an effective data processing solution. The indirect nature of the Beam model, in which your user code constructs a pipeline graph to be executed remotely, can make debugging-failed runs a non-trivial task. Often it is faster and simpler to perform local unit testing on your pipeline code than to debug a pipelineâ€™s remote execution.

You can read more about testing on the Apache Beam website:
https://beam.apache.org/documentation/pipelines/test-your-pipeline/.

**Kata:** Develop test case assertion that checks whether the PCollection elements are equal to the given input from task.HelloBeam.

<div class="hint">
  <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/testing/passert#Equals">passert.Equals</a>
  from the package passert verifies the given collection has the same values as the given values, under coder equality.
  The values can be provided as a single PCollection.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/testing/ptest#Run">ptest.Run</a>
  from the package ptest runs a pipeline for testing.  The semantics of the pipeline is expected to be verified
  through passert.
