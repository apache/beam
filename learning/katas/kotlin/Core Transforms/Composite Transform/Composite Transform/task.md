Composite Transform
-------------------

Transforms can have a nested structure, where a complex transform performs multiple simpler
transforms (such as more than one ParDo, Combine, GroupByKey, or even other composite transforms).
These transforms are called composite transforms. Nesting multiple transforms inside a single
composite transform can make your code more modular and easier to understand.

To create your own composite transform, create a subclass of the PTransform class and override the
expand method to specify the actual processing logic. You can then use this transform just as you
would a built-in transform from the Beam SDK. For the PTransform class type parameters, you pass
the PCollection types that your transform takes as input, and produces as output. Within your
PTransform subclass, youâ€™ll need to override the expand method. The expand method is where you add
the processing logic for the PTransform. Your override of expand must accept the appropriate type
of input PCollection as a parameter, and specify the output PCollection as the return value.

**Kata:** Please implement a composite transform "ExtractAndMultiplyNumbers" that extracts numbers
from comma separated line and then multiplies each number by 10.
