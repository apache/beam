Window Accumulation Mode
------------------------

When you specify a trigger, you must also set the the windowâ€™s accumulation mode. When a trigger
fires, it emits the current contents of the window as a pane. Since a trigger can fire multiple
times, the accumulation mode determines whether the system accumulates the window panes as the
trigger fires, or discards them.

**Kata:** Given that events are being generated every second and a fixed window of 1-day duration,
please implement an early trigger that emits the number of events count immediately after new
element is processed in accumulating mode.

  Use <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.13.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/windowing/Window.html#accumulatingFiredPanes--">
  accumulatingFiredPanes()</a> to set a window to accumulate the panes that are produced when the
  trigger fires.
