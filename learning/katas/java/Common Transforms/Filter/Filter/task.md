Filter
------

The Beam SDKs provide language-specific ways to simplify how you provide your DoFn implementation.

**Kata:** Implement a filter function that filters out the odd numbers by using
[Filter](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/Filter.html).

<div class="hint">
  Use <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/Filter.html">
  Filter.by(...)</a>.
