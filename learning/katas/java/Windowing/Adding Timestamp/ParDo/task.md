Adding Timestamp - ParDo
------------------------

Bounded sources (such as a file from TextIO) do not provide timestamps for elements. If you need
timestamps, you must add them to your PCollection’s elements.

You can assign new timestamps to the elements of a PCollection by applying a ParDo transform that
outputs new elements with timestamps that you set.

**Kata:** Please assign each element a timestamp based on the the `Event.getDate()`.
