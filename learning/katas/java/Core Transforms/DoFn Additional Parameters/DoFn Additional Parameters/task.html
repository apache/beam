<h2>DoFn Additional Parameters</h2>
<p>
  In addition to the element and the OutputReceiver, Beam will populate other parameters to your
  DoFnâ€™s @ProcessElement method. Any combination of these parameters can be added to your process
  method in any order.
</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Timestamp</b>: To access the timestamp of an input element, add a parameter annotated with
      @Timestamp of type Instant
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Window</b>: To access the window an input element falls into, add a parameter of the type of the
      window used for the input PCollection.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>PaneInfo</b>: When triggers are used, Beam provides a PaneInfo object that contains information
      about the current firing. Using PaneInfo you can determine whether this is an early or a
      late firing, and how many times this window has already fired for this key.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>PipelineOptions</b>: The PipelineOptions for the current pipeline can always be accessed in a
      process method by adding it as a parameter.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
