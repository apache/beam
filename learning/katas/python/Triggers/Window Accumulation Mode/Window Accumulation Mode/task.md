Window Accumulation Mode
------------------------

When you specify a trigger, you must also set the the windowâ€™s accumulation mode. When a trigger
fires, it emits the current contents of the window as a pane. Since a trigger can fire multiple
times, the accumulation mode determines whether the system accumulates the window panes as the
trigger fires, or discards them.

**Kata:** Given that sample events generated with one second granularity and a fixed window of 1-day duration,
please implement an early trigger that emits the number of events count immediately after new
element is processed in accumulating mode.
