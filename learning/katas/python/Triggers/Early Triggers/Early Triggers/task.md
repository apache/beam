Early Triggers
--------------

Triggers allow Beam to emit early results, before all the data in a given window has arrived. For
example, emitting after a certain amount of time elapses, or after a certain number of elements
arrives.

**Kata:** Given that sample events generated with one second granularity and a fixed window of 1-day duration,
please implement an early trigger that emits the number of events count immediately after new
element is processed.
