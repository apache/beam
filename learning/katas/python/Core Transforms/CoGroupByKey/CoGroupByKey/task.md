CoGroupByKey
------------

CoGroupByKey performs a relational join of two or more key/value PCollections that have the same
key type.

**Kata:** Implement a
[CoGroupByKey](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.transforms.util.html#apache_beam.transforms.util.CoGroupByKey)
transform that join words by its first alphabetical letter, and then produces the string
representation of the WordsAlphabet model.
