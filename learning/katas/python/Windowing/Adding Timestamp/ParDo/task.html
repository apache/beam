<h2>Adding Timestamp - ParDo</h2>
<p>
  Bounded sources (such as a file from TextIO) do not provide timestamps for elements. If you need
  timestamps, you must add them to your PCollection’s elements.
</p>
<p>
  You can assign new timestamps to the elements of a PCollection by applying a ParDo transform that
  outputs new elements with timestamps that you set.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Kata:</b> Please assign each element a timestamp based on the the <code>Event.date</code>.
</p>
