Welcome To Apache Beam
----------------------

Apache Beam is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel
processing pipelines. Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, you build a program that defines the 
pipeline. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beamâ€™s supported distributed processing back-ends,
which include Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.

Beam is particularly useful for Embarrassingly Parallel data processing tasks, in which the problem 
can be decomposed into many smaller bundles of data that can be processed independently and in 
parallel. You can also use Beam for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tasks and pure data 
integration. These tasks are useful for moving data between different storage media and data 
sources, transforming data into a more desirable format, or loading data onto a new system.

To learn more about Apache Beam, refer to 
[Apache Beam Overview](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/beam-overview/).

**Kata:** Your first kata is to create a simple pipeline that takes a hardcoded input element 
"Hello Beam".
