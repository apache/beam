# Filter

### Using Filter

PCollection datasets can be filtered using the Filter transform. You can create a filter by supplying a predicate and, when applied, filtering out all the elements of PCollection that donâ€™t satisfy the predicate.

```
import (
  "github.com/apache/fbeam/sdks/go/pkg/beam"
  "github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/transforms/filter"
)

func ApplyTransform(s beam.Scope, input beam.PCollection) beam.PCollection {
  return filter.Exclude(s, input, func(element int) bool {
    return element % 2 == 1
  })
}
```

You can find the full code of this example in the playground window, which you can run and experiment with.

`filter.Exclude` excludes a number if it is divisible by 2 with a remainder. If you make an `filte.Include` filter, it will work the other way around, it will filter elements that satisfy the filter logic

Have you also noticed the order in which the collection items are displayed in the console? Why is that? You can also run the example several times to see if the output remains the same or changes.
