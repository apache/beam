# Partition

`Partition` is a Beam transform for `PCollection` objects that store the same data type. `Partition` splits a single `PCollection` into a fixed number of smaller collections.

`Partition` divides the elements of a `PCollection` according to a partitioning function that you provide. The partitioning function contains the logic that determines how to split up the elements of the input `PCollection` into each resulting partition `PCollection`. The number of partitions must be determined at graph construction time. You can, for example, pass the number of partitions as a command-line option at runtime (which will then be used to build your pipeline graph), but you cannot determine the number of partitions in mid-pipeline (based on data calculated after your pipeline graph is constructed, for instance).

The following example divides a `PCollection` into percentile `groups.Partition`.

```
func decileFn(student Student) int {
	return int(float64(student.Percentile) / float64(10))
}

// Partition returns a slice of PCollections
studentsByPercentile := beam.Partition(s, 10, decileFn, students)

// Each partition can be extracted by indexing into the slice.
fortiethPercentile := studentsByPercentile[4]
```

### Playground exercise

You can find the full code of this example in the playground window, which you can run and experiment with.

The `applyTransforms` returns a slice of the PCollection, you can access it by index. In this case, we have two `PCollections`, one consists of numbers that are less than 100, the second is more than 100.

You can also divide other types into parts, for example: "strings" and others.

Before you start, add a dependency:
```
"strings"
```

It is necessary to divide sentences into words. To do this, we use `ParDo`:
```
func extractWords(s beam.Scope, input beam.PCollection) beam.PCollection {
	return beam.ParDo(s, func(line string, emit func(string)){
    words := strings.Split(line, " ")
		for _, k := range words {
			word := string(k)
			if word != " " {
				emit(word)
			}
		}
	}, input)
}
```

Change the type of `integers` to `strings`:
```
func applyTransform(s beam.Scope, input beam.PCollection) []beam.PCollection {
	return beam.Partition(s, 2, func(element string) int {
		if element==strings.Title(element) {
			return 0
		}
		return 1
	}, input)
}
```

It is necessary to enter `strings` of `integers` together. Make a `PCollection` of them that contains words. Divide into portions:

```
input := beam.Create(s, "Apache Beam is an open source unified programming model","To define and execute data processing pipelines","Go SDK")

words := extractWords(s,input)

output := applyTransform(s, words)

debug.Printf(s, "Upper: %v", output[0])
debug.Printf(s, "Lower: %v", output[1])
```
