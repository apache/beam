# CombinePerKey

For `Map` collection with a key (for example, using the groupByKey transformation), a common pattern is to combine a collection of values associated with each key into one combined value. Approximately it will look like this:

```
cat, [1,5,9]
dog, [5,2]
and, [1,2,6]
jump, [3]
tree, [2]
...
```

In the above `PCollection`, each element has a string key (for example, “cat”) and an iterable of integers for its value (in the first element, containing [1, 5, 9]). If our pipeline’s next processing step combines the values (rather than considering them individually), you can combine the iterable of integers to create a single, merged value to be paired with each key. This pattern of a GroupByKey followed by merging the collection of values is equivalent to Beam’s `Combine` `PerKey` transform. The combine function you supply to `Combine` `PerKey` must be an associative reduction function or a subclass of `CombineFn`.

```
// PCollection is grouped by key and the numeric values associated with each key
// are averaged into a float64.
animalCount := ... // PCollection<string,int>

avgAccuracyPerPlayer := stats.MeanPerKey(s, animalCount)

// avgAnimalCount is a PCollection<string,float64>
```

### Playground exercise

You can find the full code of this example in the playground window, which you can run and experiment with.

The input data consists of a card (key-value), in this case the key is the player's number, the value of the point won. Combine PerKey groups by key and combine values

You change the numbers to a string, the key of which will be the first letter of the fruit, to the value of the full name of the fruit:

```
input := beam.ParDo(s, func(_ []byte, emit func(string, string)){
		emit("a", "apple")
		emit("o", "orange")
		emit("a", "avocado")
		emit("l", "lemon")
		emit("l", "limes")
	}, beam.Impulse(s))
```

You combine by key by inserting a comma between them:
```
func applyTransform(s beam.Scope, input beam.PCollection) beam.PCollection {
	return beam.CombinePerKey(s, func(name1, name2 string) string {
        return name1+","+name2
	}, input)
}
```
