### Sliding time windows

A sliding time window also represents time intervals in the data stream; however, sliding time windows can overlap. For example, each window might capture 60 seconds worth of data, but a new window starts every 30 seconds. The frequency with which sliding windows begin is called the period. Therefore, our example would have a window duration of 60 seconds and a period of 30 seconds.

Because multiple windows overlap, most elements in a data set will belong to more than one window. This kind of windowing is useful for taking running averages of data; using sliding time windows, you can compute a running average of the past 60 secondsâ€™ worth of data, updated every 30 seconds.


The following example code shows how to apply `Window` to divide a `PCollection` into sliding time windows. Each window is 30 seconds in length, and a new window begins every five seconds:
```
slidingWindowedItems := beam.WindowInto(s,
	window.NewSlidingWindows(5*time.Second, 30*time.Second),
	items)
```
