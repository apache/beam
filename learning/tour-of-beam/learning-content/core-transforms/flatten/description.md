# Flatten

`Flatten` is a Beam transform for `PCollection` objects that store the same data type. `Flatten` merges multiple PCollection objects into a single logical `PCollection`.

The following example shows how to apply a `Flatten` transform to merge multiple `PCollection` objects.

{{if (eq .Sdk "go")}}
```
// Flatten accepts any number of PCollections of the same element type.
// Returns a single PCollection that contains all of the elements in input PCollections.

merged := beam.Flatten(s, input1, input2, input3)
```
{{end}}

{{if (eq .Sdk "java")}}
```
// Flatten takes a PCollectionList of PCollection objects of a given type.
// Returns a single PCollection that contains all of the elements in the PCollection objects in that list.
PCollection<String> input1 = ...;
PCollection<String> input2 = ...;
PCollection<String> input3 = ...;
PCollectionList<String> collections = PCollectionList.of(input1).and(input2).and(input3);

PCollection<String> merged = collections.apply(Flatten.<String>pCollections());
```
{{end}}

{{if (eq .Sdk "python")}}
```
# Flatten takes a tuple of PCollection objects.
# Returns a single PCollection that contains all of the elements in the PCollection objects in that tuple.

merged = (
    # A list of tuples can be "piped" directly into a Flatten transform.
    (pcoll1, pcoll2, pcoll3) | beam.Flatten())
```
{{end}}

### Data encoding in merged collections

By default, the coder for the output `PCollection` is the same as the coder for the first `PCollection` in the input `PCollectionList`. However, the input `PCollection` objects can each use different coders, as long as they all contain the same data type in your chosen language.

### Merging windowed collections

When using `Flatten` to merge `PCollection` objects that have a windowing strategy applied, all of the `PCollection` objects you want to merge must use a compatible windowing strategy and window sizing. For example, all the collections youâ€™re merging must all use (hypothetically) identical 5-minute fixed windows or 4-minute sliding windows starting every 30 seconds.

If your pipeline attempts to use `Flatten` to merge `PCollection` objects with incompatible windows, Beam generates an IllegalStateException error when your pipeline is constructed.

### Playground exercise

You can find the full code of this example in the playground window, which you can run and experiment with.

{{if (eq .Sdk "go")}}
Before you start, add a dependency:
```
"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/pkg/beam/io/textio"
```

You can also combine data from a file:
```
input1 := textio.Read(s, "gs://apache-beam-samples/counts-00000-of-00003")
input2 := textio.Read(s, "gs://apache-beam-samples/counts-00001-of-00003")

output := applyTransform(s, input1, input2)
```
{{end}}

{{if (eq .Sdk "java")}}
```
PCollection<String> input1 = pipeline.apply(TextIO.read().from("gs://apache-beam-samples/counts-00000-of-00003"));
PCollection<String> input2 = pipeline.apply(TextIO.read().from("gs://apache-beam-samples/counts-00001-of-00003"));

PCollectionList<String> collections = PCollectionList.of(input1).and(input2);

PCollection<String> merged = collections.apply(Flatten.<String>pCollections());
```
{{end}}

{{if (eq .Sdk "python")}}
```
input1 = (p | 'Log lines' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://apache-beam-samples/counts-00000-of-00003')
   | beam.ParDo(ExtractFn()))

input2 = (p | 'Log lines' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://apache-beam-samples/counts-00001-of-00003')
   | beam.ParDo(ExtractFn()))

merged = ((input1, input2) | beam.Flatten())
```
{{end}}
