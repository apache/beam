# Side inputs
In addition to the main input `PCollection`, you can provide additional inputs to a `ParDo` transform in the form of side inputs. A side input is an additional input that your DoFn can access each time it processes an element in the input PCollection. When you specify a side input, you create a view of some other data that can be read from within the ParDo transformâ€™s DoFn while processing each element.

Side inputs are useful if your `ParDo` needs to inject additional data when processing each element in the input PCollection, but the additional data needs to be determined at runtime (and not hard-coded). Such values might be determined by the input data, or depend on a different branch of your pipeline.

### Passing side inputs to ParDo

```
# Side inputs are available as extra arguments in the DoFn's process method or Map / FlatMap's callable.
# Optional, positional, and keyword arguments are all supported. Deferred arguments are unwrapped into their
# actual values. For example, using pvalue.AsIteor(pcoll) at pipeline construction time results in an iterable
# of the actual elements of pcoll being passed into each process invocation. In this example, side inputs are
# passed to a FlatMap transform as extra arguments and consumed by filter_using_length.
words = ...

# Callable takes additional arguments.
def filter_using_length(word, lower_bound, upper_bound=float('inf')):
  if lower_bound <= len(word) <= upper_bound:
    yield word

# Construct a deferred side input.
avg_word_len = (
    words
    | beam.Map(len)
    | beam.CombineGlobally(beam.combiners.MeanCombineFn()))

# Call with explicit side inputs.
small_words = words | 'small' >> beam.FlatMap(filter_using_length, 0, 3)

# A single deferred side input.
larger_than_average = (
    words | 'large' >> beam.FlatMap(
        filter_using_length, lower_bound=pvalue.AsSingleton(avg_word_len))
)

# Mix and match.
small_but_nontrivial = words | beam.FlatMap(
    filter_using_length,
    lower_bound=2,
    upper_bound=pvalue.AsSingleton(avg_word_len))


# We can also pass side inputs to a ParDo transform, which will get passed to its process method.
# The first two arguments for the process method would be self and element.


class FilterUsingLength(beam.DoFn):
  def process(self, element, lower_bound, upper_bound=float('inf')):
    if lower_bound <= len(element) <= upper_bound:
      yield element

small_words = words | beam.ParDo(FilterUsingLength(), 0, 3)


```

### Playground exercise

You can find the full code of this example in the playground window, which you can run and experiment with.

At the entrance we have a map whose key is the city of the country value. And we also have a `Person` structure with his name and city. We can compare cities and embed countries in `Person`.

You can also use it as a variable for mathematical calculations.

Before you start, add a dependency:
```
"fmt"
"time"
```

Changing `citiesToCountriesKV` to `citiesToTimeKV`:
```
citiesToTimeKV := beam.ParDo(s, func(_ []byte, emit func(string, int)){
		emit("Beijing", 8)
		emit("London", 0)
		emit("San Francisco", -8)
		emit("Singapore", 8)
		emit("Sydney", 11)
}, beam.Impulse(s))
```

Calculate the current time and add GMT:

```
func joinFn(person Person, citiesToCountriesIter func(*string,*int) bool, emit func(Person)) {
var city string
var gmt int
now := time.Now()

for citiesToCountriesIter(&city,&gmt) {
    time := now.Hour()+gmt

	if person.City == city {
        if time < 0 {
            time = 24 + (now.Hour() + gmt)
        }
		emit(Person{
		    Name:    person.Name,
			City:    city,
            Time: (fmt.Sprintf("%d:%d",time,now.Minute())),
		})
		break
		}
	}
}
```

Have you also noticed the order in which the collection items are displayed in the console? Why is that? You can also run the example several times to see if the output remains the same or changes.
