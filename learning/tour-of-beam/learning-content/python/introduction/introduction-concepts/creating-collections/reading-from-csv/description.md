### Read from csv file

Data processing pipelines often work with tabular data. In many examples and challenges throughout the course, youâ€™ll be working with one of the datasets stored as csv files in either beam-examples, dataflow-samples buckets.

Loading data from csv file requires some processing and consists of two main part:
* Loading text lines using `TextIO.Read` transform
* Parsing lines of text into tabular format

Try to experiment with an example in the playground window and modify the code to process other fields from New York taxi rides dataset.
Here is a list of fields and a sample record from this dataset:

`VendorID,tpep_pickup_datetime,tpep_dropoff_datetime,passenger_count,trip_distance,RatecodeID,store_and_fwd_flag,PULocationID,DOLocationID,payment_type,fare_amount,extra,mta_tax,tip_amount,tolls_amount,improvement_surcharge,total_amount`
