### Read from csv file

Data processing pipelines often work with tabular data. In many examples and challenges throughout the course, youâ€™ll be working with one of the datasets stored as csv files in either beam-examples, dataflow-samples buckets.

Loading data from csv file requires some processing and consists of two main part:
* Loading text lines using `TextIO.Read` transform
* Parsing lines of text into tabular format

### Playground exercise

Try to experiment with an example in the playground window and modify the code to process other fields from New York taxi rides dataset.

Here is a small list of fields and an example record from this dataset:

| cost | passenger_count | ... |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| 5.8  | 1               | ... |
| 4.6  | 2               | ... |
| 24   | 1               | ... |
