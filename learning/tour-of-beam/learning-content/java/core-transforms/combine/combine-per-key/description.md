# CombinePerKey

For a collection of maps with a shared key, you can combine collections of values associated with each key into one combined value using `Combine`.

Initial data:
```
  KV<cat, 1>
  KV<dog, 5>
  KV<dog, 6>
  KV<cat, 3>
  KV<tree, 2>
  ...
```

After conversion:
```
  KV<cat, 4>
  KV<dog, 11>
  KV<tree, 2>
```

```
static PCollection<KV<String, Integer>> combine(PCollection<KV<String, Integer>> input) {
        return input.apply(Combine.perKey(new SumCombineFn()));
    }

static class SumCombineFn extends Combine.BinaryCombineFn<Integer> {
        @Override
        public Integer apply(Integer left, Integer right) {
            return left + right;
        }
    }
```

### Playground exercise

You can find the full code of this example in the playground window, which you can run and experiment with.

You can use other types instead of `Integer`:

```
static class ConcateStringFn extends BinaryCombineFn<String> {
    @Override
    public String apply(String left, String right) {
      return left+","+right;
    }
}
```
