# Joins

A transform that performs equijoins across two schema PCollections.

This transform allows joins between two input `PCollections` simply by specifying the fields to join on. The resulting `PCollection<Row>` will have two fields named "**lhs**" and "**rhs**" respectively, each with the schema of the corresponding input `PCollection`.

For example, the following demonstrates joining two `PCollections` using a natural join on the "**user**" and "**country**" fields, where both the left-hand and the right-hand `PCollections` have fields with these names.

```
PCollection<Row> joined = pCollection1.apply(Join.innerJoin(pCollection2).using("user", "country"));
```

If the right-hand `PCollection` contains fields with different names to join against, you can specify them as follows:

```
PCollection<Row> joined = pCollection1.apply(Join.innerJoin(pCollection2)
       .on(FieldsEqual.left("user", "country").right("otherUser", "otherCountry")));
```
