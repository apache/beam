              l3: Element-wise transformation parameterized by a chunk of user code. Elements are processed in bundles, with initialization and termination hooks. Bundle size is chosen by the runner and cannot be controlled by user code. ParDo processes a main input PCollection one element at a time, but provides side input access to additional PCollections.

              l3: Side inputs are additional <tt>PCollections</tt> whose contents are computed during pipeline execution and then made accessible to DoFn code. The exact shape of the side input depends both on the <tt>PCollectionView</tt> used to describe the access pattern (interable, map, singleton) and the window of the element from the main input that is currently being processed.

Semantically equivalent to using a side output, but support partial results as the transform executes.

              l3: Allows fine-grained access to per-key, per-window persistent state. Necessary for certain use cases (e.g. high-volume windows which store large amounts of data, but typically only access small portions of it; complex state machines; etc.) that are not easily or efficiently addressed via <tt>Combine</tt> or <tt>GroupByKey</tt>+<tt>ParDo</tt>.
