              l3: Allows users to develop DoFn's that process a single element in portions ("restrictions"), executed in parallel or sequentially. This supersedes the unbounded and bounded `Source` APIs by supporting all of their features on a per-element basis. See http://s.apache.org/splittable-do-fn. Design is in progress on achieving parity with Source API regarding progress signals.
