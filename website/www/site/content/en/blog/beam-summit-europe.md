### What is the Beam Summit 2018?
The summit is a 2 day, multi-track event.

During the first day weâ€™ll host sessions to share use cases from companies using Apache Beam, community driven talks, and a session to discuss the project's roadmap (from the main partners in the project as well as all users planning to contribute to the project and wanting to share their plans). We'll also have break-out sessions that will allow cross team collaboration in multiple sub-topics.

The second day will be a "hands-on" day. We will offer an introductory session to Apache Beam. Additionally, we'll host an advanced track for more advanced users with open-table discussions about more complex and newer Apache Beam features.

The agenda will grow and be communicated in the coming month, keep an eye on the page.
