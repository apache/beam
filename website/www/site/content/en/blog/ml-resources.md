If you've been paying attention, over the past year you've noticed that
Beam has released a number of features designed to make Machine Learning
easy. Ranging from things like the introduction of the `RunInference`
transform to the continued refining of `Beam Dataframes`, this has been
an area where we've seen Beam make huge strides. While development has
advanced quickly, however, until recently there has been a lack of
resources to help people discover and use these new features.

Over the past several months, we've been hard at work building out
documentation and notebooks to make it easier to use these new features
and to show how Beam can be used to solve common Machine Learning problems.
We're now happy to present this new and improved Beam ML experience!

To get started, we encourage you to visit Beam's new [AI/ML landing page](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/overview/).
We've got plenty of content on things like [multi-model pipelines](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/multi-model-pipelines/),
[performing inference with metrics](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/runinference-metrics/),
[online training](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/online-clustering/), and much more.

We've also introduced a number of example [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml)
showing how to use built in beam transforms like `RunInference` and `Beam Dataframes`.

Adding more examples and notebooks will be a point of emphasis going forward.
For our next round of improvements, we are planning on adding examples of
using RunInference with >30GB models, with multi-language pipelines, with
common Beam concepts, and with TensorRT. We will also add examples showing
other pieces of the Machine Learning lifecycle like model evaluation with TFMA,
per-entity training, and more online training.

We hope you find this useful! As always, if you see any areas for improvement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/new/choose)
or a [pull request](https://github.com/apache/beam/pulls)!
