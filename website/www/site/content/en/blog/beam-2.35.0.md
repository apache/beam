We are happy to present the new 2.35.0 release of Apache Beam.
This release includes both improvements and new functionality.
See the [download page](/get-started/downloads/#2350-2021-12-29) for this release.

For more information on changes in 2.35.0, check out the [detailed release
notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319527&version=12350406).

## Highlights

* MultiMap side inputs are now supported by the Go SDK ([BEAM-3293](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3293)).
* Side inputs are supported within Splittable DoFns for Dataflow Runner V1 and Dataflow Runner V2. ([BEAM-12522](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12522)).
* Upgrades Log4j version used in test suites (Apache Beam testing environment only, not for end user consumption) to 2.17.0([BEAM-13434](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13434)).
    Note that Apache Beam versions do not depend on the Log4j 2 dependency (log4j-core) impacted by [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228).
    However we urge users to update direct and indirect dependencies (if any) on Log4j 2 to the latest version by updating their build configuration and redeploying impacted pipelines.

## I/Os

* We changed the data type for ranges in `JdbcIO.readWithPartitions` from `int` to `long` ([BEAM-13149](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13149)).
    This is a relatively minor breaking change, which we're implementing to improve the usability of the transform without increasing cruft.
    This transform is relatively new, so we may implement other breaking changes in the future to improve its usability.
* Side inputs are supported within Splittable DoFns for Dataflow Runner V1 and Dataflow Runner V2. ([BEAM-12522](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12522)).

## New Features / Improvements

* Added custom delimiters to Python TextIO reads ([BEAM-12730](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12730)).
* Added escapechar parameter to Python TextIO reads ([BEAM-13189](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13189)).
* Splittable reading is enabled by default while reading data with ParquetIO ([BEAM-12070](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12070)).
* DoFn Execution Time metrics added to Go ([BEAM-13001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13001)).
* Cross-bundle side input caching is now available in the Go SDK for runners that support the feature by setting the EnableSideInputCache hook ([BEAM-11097](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11097)).
* Upgraded the GCP Libraries BOM version to 24.0.0 and associated dependencies ([BEAM-11205](
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11205)). For Google Cloud client library versions set by this BOM,
  see [this table](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-opensource-java-dashboard/com.google.cloud/libraries-bom/24.0.0/artifact_details.html).
* Removed avro-python3 dependency in AvroIO. Fastavro has already been our Avro library of choice on Python 3. Boolean use_fastavro is left for api compatibility, but will have no effect.([BEAM-13016](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15900)).
* MultiMap side inputs are now supported by the Go SDK ([BEAM-3293](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3293)).
* Remote packages can now be downloaded from locations supported by apache_beam.io.filesystems. The files will be downloaded on Stager and uploaded to staging location. For more information, see [BEAM-11275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11275)

## Breaking Changes

* A new URN convention was adopted for cross-language transforms and existing URNs were updated. This may break advanced use-cases, for example, if a custom expansion service is used to connect diffrent Beam Java and Python versions. ([BEAM-12047](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12047)).
* The upgrade to Calcite 1.28.0 introduces a breaking change in the SUBSTRING function in SqlTransform, when used with the Calcite dialect ([BEAM-13099](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13099), [CALCITE-4427](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4427)).
* ListShards (with DescribeStreamSummary) is used instead of DescribeStream to list shards in Kinesis streams (AWS SDK v2). Due to this change, as mentioned in [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_ListShards.html), for fine-grained IAM policies it is required to update them to allow calls to ListShards and DescribeStreamSummary APIs. For more information, see [Controlling Access to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/controlling-access.html) ([BEAM-13233](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13233)).

## Deprecations

* Non-splittable reading is deprecated while reading data with ParquetIO ([BEAM-12070](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12070)).

## Bugfixes

* Properly map main input windows to side input windows by default (Go)
  ([BEAM-11087](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11087)).
* Fixed data loss when writing to DynamoDB without setting deduplication key names (Java)
  ([BEAM-13009](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13009)).
* Go SDK Examples now have types and functions registered. (Go) ([BEAM-5378](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5378))
* Fixed data loss when using Python WriteToFiles in streaming pipeline ([BEAM-12950](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12950)).

## Known Issues

* Users of beam-sdks-java-io-hcatalog (and beam-sdks-java-extensions-sql-hcatalog) must take care to override the transitive log4j dependency when they add a hive dependency ([BEAM-13499](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13499)).
