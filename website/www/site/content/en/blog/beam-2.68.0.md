We are happy to present the new 2.68.0 release of Beam.
This release includes both improvements and new functionality.
See the [download page](/get-started/downloads/#2680-2025-09-??) for this release.

For more information on changes in 2.68.0, check out the [detailed release notes](https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/36?closed=1).

## Highlights

* [Python] Prism runner now enabled by default for most Python pipelines using the direct runner ([#34612](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34612)). This may break some tests, see https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34612 for details on how to handle issues.

### I/Os

* Upgraded Iceberg dependency to 1.9.2 ([#35981](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/35981))

### New Features / Improvements

* BigtableRead Connector for BeamYaml added with new Config Param ([#35696](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/35696))
* MongoDB Java driver upgraded from 3.12.11 to 5.5.0 with API refactoring and GridFS implementation updates (Java) ([#35946](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/35946)).
* Introduced a dedicated module for JUnit-based testing support: `sdks/java/testing/junit`, which provides `TestPipelineExtension` for JUnit 5 while maintaining backward compatibility with existing JUnit 4 `TestRule`-based tests (Java) ([#18733](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/18733), [#35688](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/35688)).
  - To use JUnit 5 with Beam tests, add a test-scoped dependency on `org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-testing-junit`.
* Google CloudSQL enrichment handler added (Python) ([#34398](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34398)).
  Beam now supports data enrichment capabilities using SQL databases, with built-in support for:
  - Managed PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server instances on CloudSQL
  - Unmanaged SQL database instances not hosted on CloudSQL (e.g., self-hosted or on-premises databases)
* [Python] Added the `ReactiveThrottler` and `ThrottlingSignaler` classes to streamline throttling behavior in DoFns, expose throttling mechanisms for users ([#35984](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/35984))
* Added a pipeline option to specify the processing timeout for a single element by any PTransform (Java/Python/Go) ([#35174](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35174)).
  - When specified, the SDK harness automatically restarts if an element takes too long to process. Beam runner may then retry processing of the same work item.
  - Use the `--element_processing_timeout_minutes` option to reduce the chance of having stalled pipelines due to unexpected cases of slow processing, where slowness might not happen again if processing of the same element is retried.
* (Python) Adding GCP Spanner Change Stream support for Python (apache_beam.io.gcp.spanner) ([#24103](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/24103)).

### Breaking Changes

* Previously deprecated Beam ZetaSQL component has been removed ([#34423](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/34423)).
  ZetaSQL users could migrate to Calcite SQL with BigQuery dialect enabled.
* Upgraded Beam vendored Calcite to 1.40.0 for Beam SQL ([#35483](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35483)), which
  improves support for BigQuery and other SQL dialects. Note: Minor behavior changes are observed such as output
  significant digits related to casting.
* (Python) The deterministic fallback coder for complex types like NamedTuple, Enum, and dataclasses now uses cloudpickle instead of dill. If your pipeline is affected, you may see a warning like: "Using fallback deterministic coder for type X...". You can revert to the previous behavior by using the pipeline option `--update_compatibility_version=2.67.0` ([35725](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/35725)). Report any pickling related issues to [#34903](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/34903)
* (Python) Prism runner now enabled by default for most Python pipelines using the direct runner ([#34612](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34612)). This may break some tests, see https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34612 for details on how to handle issues.
* Dropped Java 8 support for [IO expansion-service](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.beam/beam-sdks-java-io-expansion-service). Cross-language pipelines using this expansion service will need a Java11+ runtime ([#35981](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/35981).

### Deprecations

* Python SDK native SpannerIO (apache_beam/io/gcp/experimental/spannerio) is deprecated. Use cross-language wrapper
  (apache_beam/io/gcp/spanner) instead (Python) ([#35860](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35860)).
* Samza runner is deprecated and scheduled for removal in Beam 3.0 ([#35448](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35448)).
* Twister2 runner is deprecated and scheduled for removal in Beam 3.0 ([#35905](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35905))).

### Bugfixes

* (Python) Fixed Java YAML provider fails on Windows ([#35617](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35617)).
* Fixed BigQueryIO creating temporary datasets in wrong project when temp_dataset is specified with a different project than the pipeline project. For some jobs, temporary datasets will now be created in the correct project (Python) ([#35813](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35813)).
* (Go) Fix duplicates due to reads after blind writes to Bag State ([#35869](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35869)).
  * Earlier Go SDK versions can avoid the issue by not reading in the same call after a blind write.
