## Highlights
* The [Beam DataFrame
  API](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/dataframes/overview/) is no
  longer experimental! We've spent the time since the [2.26.0 preview
  announcement](https://beam.apache.org/blog/dataframe-api-preview-available/)
  implementing the most frequently used pandas operations
  ([BEAM-9547](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9547)), improving
  [documentation](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.dataframe.html)
  and [error messages](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12028),
  adding
  [examples](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/dataframe),
  integrating DataFrames with [interactive
  Beam](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.runners.interactive.interactive_beam.html),
  and of course finding and fixing
  [bugs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%3DBEAM%20AND%20issuetype%3DBug%20AND%20status%3DResolved%20AND%20component%3Ddsl-dataframe).
  Leaving experimental just means that we now have high confidence in the API
  and recommend its use for production workloads. We will continue to improve
  the API, guided by your
  [feedback](https://beam.apache.org/community/contact-us/).


## I/Os

* Added ability to use JdbcIO.Write.withResults without statement and preparedStatementSetter. ([BEAM-12511](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12511))
- Added ability to register URI schemes to use the S3 protocol via FileIO. ([BEAM-12435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12435)).
* Respect number of shards set in SnowflakeWrite batch mode. ([BEAM-12715](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12715))
* Java SDK: Update Google Cloud Healthcare IO connectors from using v1beta1 to using the GA version.

## New Features / Improvements

* Add support to convert Beam Schema to Avro Schema for JDBC LogicalTypes:
  `VARCHAR`, `NVARCHAR`, `LONGVARCHAR`, `LONGNVARCHAR`, `DATE`, `TIME`
  (Java)([BEAM-12385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12385)).
* Reading from JDBC source by partitions (Java) ([BEAM-12456](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12456)).
* PubsubIO can now write to a dead-letter topic after a parsing error (Java)([BEAM-12474](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12474)).
* New append-only option for Elasticsearch sink (Java) [BEAM-12601](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12601)

## Breaking Changes

* ListShards (with DescribeStreamSummary) is used instead of DescribeStream to list shards in Kinesis streams. Due to this change, as mentioned in [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_ListShards.html), for fine-grained IAM policies it is required to update them to allow calls to ListShards and DescribeStreamSummary APIs. For more information, see [Controlling Access to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/controlling-access.html) ([BEAM-12225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12225)).

## Deprecations

* Python GBK will stop supporting unbounded PCollections that have global windowing and a default trigger in Beam 2.33. This can be overriden with `--allow_unsafe_triggers`. ([BEAM-9487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9487)).
* Python GBK will start requiring safe triggers or the `--allow_unsafe_triggers` flag starting with Beam 2.33. ([BEAM-9487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9487)).

## Bugfixes

* Fixed race condition in RabbitMqIO causing duplicate acks (Java) ([BEAM-6516](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6516)))
