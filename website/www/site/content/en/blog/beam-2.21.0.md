We are happy to present the new 2.21.0 release of Beam. This release includes both improvements and new functionality.
See the [download page](/get-started/downloads/#2210-2020-05-27) for this release.
For more information on changes in 2.21.0, check out the
[detailed release notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319527&version=12347143).

## I/Os
* Python: Deprecated module `apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.v1` has been removed
as the client it uses is out of date and does not support Python 3
([BEAM-9529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9529)).
Please migrate your code to use
[apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.**v1new**](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.v1new.datastoreio.html).
See the updated
[datastore_wordcount](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/cookbook/datastore_wordcount.py)
for example usage.
* Python SDK: Added integration tests and updated batch write functionality for Google Cloud Spanner transform ([BEAM-8949](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8949)).

## New Features / Improvements
* Python SDK will now use Python 3 type annotations as pipeline type hints.
([#10717](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10717))

    If you suspect that this feature is causing your pipeline to fail, calling
    `apache_beam.typehints.disable_type_annotations()` before pipeline creation
    will disable is completely, and decorating specific functions (such as
    `process()`) with `@apache_beam.typehints.no_annotations` will disable it
    for that function.

    More details can be found in
    [Ensuring Python Type Safety](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-type-safety/)
    and the Python SDK Typing Changes
    [blog post](https://beam.apache.org/blog/python-typing/).

* Java SDK: Introducing the concept of options in Beam Schema’s. These options add extra
context to fields and schemas. This replaces the current Beam metadata that is present
in a FieldType only, options are available in fields and row schemas. Schema options are
fully typed and can contain complex rows. *Remark: Schema aware is still experimental.*
([BEAM-9035](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9035))
* Java SDK: The protobuf extension is fully schema aware and also includes protobuf option
conversion to beam schema options. *Remark: Schema aware is still experimental.*
([BEAM-9044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9044))
* Added ability to write to BigQuery via Avro file loads (Python) ([BEAM-8841](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8841))

    By default, file loads will be done using JSON, but it is possible to
    specify the temp_file_format parameter to perform file exports with AVRO.
    AVRO-based file loads work by exporting Python types into Avro types, so
    to switch to Avro-based loads, you will need to change your data types
    from Json-compatible types (string-type dates and timestamp, long numeric
    values as strings) into Python native types that are written to Avro
    (Python's date, datetime types, decimal, etc). For more information
    see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-avro#avro_conversions.
* Added integration of Java SDK with Google Cloud AI VideoIntelligence service
([BEAM-9147](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9147))
* Added integration of Java SDK with Google Cloud AI natural language processing API
([BEAM-9634](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9634))
* `docker-pull-licenses` tag was introduced. Licenses/notices of third party dependencies will be added to the docker images when `docker-pull-licenses` was set.
  The files are added to `/opt/apache/beam/third_party_licenses/`.
  By default, no licenses/notices are added to the docker images. ([BEAM-9136](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9136))


## Breaking Changes

* Dataflow runner now requires the `--region` option to be set, unless a default value is set in the environment ([BEAM-9199](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9199)). See [here](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) for more details.
* HBaseIO.ReadAll now requires a PCollection of HBaseIO.Read objects instead of HBaseQuery objects ([BEAM-9279](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9279)).
* ProcessContext.updateWatermark has been removed in favor of using a WatermarkEstimator ([BEAM-9430](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9430)).
* Coder inference for PCollection of Row objects has been disabled ([BEAM-9569](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9569)).
* Go SDK docker images are no longer released until further notice.

## Deprecations
* Java SDK: Beam Schema FieldType.getMetadata is now deprecated and is replaced by the Beam
Schema Options, it will be removed in version `2.23.0`. ([BEAM-9704](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9704))
* The `--zone` option in the Dataflow runner is now deprecated. Please use `--worker_zone` instead. ([BEAM-9716](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9716))
