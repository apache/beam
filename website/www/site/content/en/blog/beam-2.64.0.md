We are happy to present the new 2.64.0 release of Beam.
This release includes both improvements and new functionality.
See the [download page](/get-started/downloads/{$DOWNLOAD_ANCHOR}) for this release.

For more information on changes in 2.64.0, check out the [detailed release notes](https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/28).
## Highlights

* Managed API for [Java](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/managed/Managed.html) and [Python](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.transforms.managed.html#module-apache_beam.transforms.managed) supports [key I/O connectors](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/connectors/) Iceberg, Kafka, and BigQuery.

## I/Os

* [Java] Use API compatible with both com.google.cloud.bigdataoss:util 2.x and 3.x in BatchLoads ([#34105](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34105))
* [IcebergIO] Added new CDC source for batch and streaming, available as `Managed.ICEBERG_CDC` ([#33504](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33504))
* [IcebergIO] Address edge case where bundle retry following a successful data commit results in data duplication ([#34264](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34264))

## New Features / Improvements

* [Python] Support custom coders in Reshuffle ([#29908](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/29908), [#33356](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33356)).
* [Java] Upgrade SLF4J to 2.0.16. Update default Spark version to 3.5.0. ([#33574](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33574))
* [Java] Support for `--add-modules` JVM option is added through a new pipeline option `JdkAddRootModules`. This allows extending the module graph with optional modules such as SDK incubator modules. Sample usage: `<pipeline invocation> --jdkAddRootModules=jdk.incubator.vector` ([#30281](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/30281)).
* Managed API for [Java](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/managed/Managed.html) and [Python](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.transforms.managed.html#module-apache_beam.transforms.managed) supports [key I/O connectors](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/connectors/) Iceberg, Kafka, and BigQuery.
* Prism now supports event time triggers for most common cases. ([#31438](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31438))
  * Prism does not yet support triggered side inputs, or triggers on merging windows (such as session windows).

## Breaking Changes

* [Python] Reshuffle now correctly respects user-specified type hints, fixing a previous bug where it might use FastPrimitivesCoder wrongly. This change could break pipelines with incorrect type hints in Reshuffle. If you have issues after upgrading, temporarily set update_compatibility_version to a previous Beam version to use the old behavior. The recommended solution is to fix the type hints in your code. ([#33932](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33932))
* [Java] SparkReceiver 2 has been moved to SparkReceiver 3 that supports Spark 3.x. ([#33574](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33574))
* [Python] Correct parsing of `collections.abc.Sequence` type hints was added, which can lead to pipelines failing type hint checks that were previously passing erroneously. These issues will be most commonly seen trying to consume a PCollection with a `Sequence` type hint after a GroupByKey or a CoGroupByKey. ([#33999](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33999)).

## Bugfixes

* (Python) Fixed occasional pipeline stuckness that was affecting Python 3.11 users ([#33966](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33966)).
* (Java) Fixed TIME field encodings for BigQuery Storage API writes on GenericRecords ([#34059](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34059)).
* (Java) Fixed a race condition in JdbcIO which could cause hangs trying to acquire a connection ([#34058](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34058)).
* (Java) Fix BigQuery Storage Write compatibility with Avro 1.8 ([#34281](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34281)).
* Fixed checkpoint recovery and streaming behavior in Spark Classic and Portable runner's Flatten transform by replacing queueStream with SingleEmitInputDStream ([#34080](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34080), [#18144](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/18144), [#20426](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/20426))
* (Java) Fixed Read caching of UnboundedReader objects to effectively cache across multiple DoFns and avoid checkpointing unstarted reader. [#34146](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/34146) [#33901](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33901)

## Known Issues

* (Java) Current version of protobuf has a [bug](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/20599) leading to incompatibilities with clients using older versions of Protobuf ([example issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/issues/2191)). This issue has been seen in SpannerIO in particular. Tracked in [#34452](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/issues/34452).
* (Java) When constructing `SpannerConfig` for `SpannerIO`, calling `withHost` with a null or empty host will now result in a Null Pointer Exception (`java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.lang.CharSequence.length()" because "this.text" is null`). See https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/issues/34489 for context.
