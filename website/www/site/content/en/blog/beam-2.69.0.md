For more information on changes in 2.69.0, check out the [detailed release notes](https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/37?closed=1).

## Highlights

* (Python) Add YAML Editor and Visualization Panel ([#35772](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35772)).
* (Java) Java 25 Support ([#35772](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35627)).

### I/Os

* Upgraded Iceberg dependency to 1.10.0 ([#36123](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36123)).

### New Features / Improvements

* Enhance JAXBCoder with XMLInputFactory support (Java) ([#36446](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36446)).
* Python examples added for CloudSQL enrichment handler on [Beam website](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/enrichment-cloudsql/) (Python) ([#35473](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36095)).
* Support for batch mode execution in WriteToPubSub transform added (Python) ([#35990](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35990)).
* Added official support for Python 3.13 ([#34869](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/34869)).
* Added an optional output_schema verification to all YAML transforms ([#35952](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/35952)).
* Support for encryption when using GroupByKey added, along with `--gbek` pipeline option to automatically replace all GroupByKey transforms (Java/Python) ([#36214](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36214)).

### Breaking Changes

* (Python) Fixed transform naming conflict when executing DataTransform on a dictionary of PColls ([#30445](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/30445)).
  This may break update compatibility if you don't provide a `--transform_name_mapping`.
* Removed deprecated Hadoop versions (2.10.2 and 3.2.4) that are no longer supported for [Iceberg](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/10940) from IcebergIO ([#36282](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36282)).
* (Go) Coder construction on SDK side is more faithful to the specs from runners without stripping length-prefix. This may break streaming pipeline update as the underlying coder could be changed ([#36387](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36387)).
* Minimum Go version for Beam Go updated to 1.25.2 ([#36461](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36461)).
* (Java) DoFn OutputReceiver now requires implementing a builder method as part of extended metadata support for elements ([#34902](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/34902)).
* (Java) Removed ProcessContext outputWindowedValue introduced in 2.68 that allowed setting offset and record Id. Use OutputReceiver's builder to set those field ([#36523]https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/36523).

### Bugfixes

* Fixed passing of pipeline options to x-lang transforms when called from the Java SDK (Java) ([#36443](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36443)).
* PulsarIO has now changed support status from incomplete to experimental. Both read and writes should now minimally
  function (un-partitioned topics, without schema support, timestamp ordered messages for read) (Java)
  ([#36141](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36141)).
* Fixed Spanner Change Stream reading stuck issue due to watermark of partition moving backwards ([#36470](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36470)).
