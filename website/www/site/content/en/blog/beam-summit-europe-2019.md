# The Apache Beam community in 2019


2019 has already been a busy time for the Apache Beam community. The ASF blog featured [our way of community building](https://blogs.apache.org/comdev/date/20190222) and we've had [more Beam meetups](https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Apache-Beam/events/257482350)  around the world. Apache Beam also received the [Technology of the Year Award](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3336072/infoworlds-2019-technology-of-the-year-award-winners.html) from InfoWorld.

As these events happened, we were building up to the [20th anniversary of the Apache Software Foundation](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/03/celebrating-20-years-of-apache.html).  The contributions of the Beam community were a part of Maximilian Michels blog post on the success of the ASF's open source development model:

In that spirit, let's have an overview of the things that have happened, what the next few months look like, and how we can foster even more community growth.


## Meetups
We've had a flurry of activity, with several meetups in the planning process and more popping up globally over time. As diversity of contributors is a core ASF value, this geographic spread is exciting for the community. Here's a picture from the latest Apache Beam meetup organized at Lyft in San Francisco:

We have more [Bay Area meetups](https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Apache-Beam) coming soon, and the community is looking into kicking off a meetup in Toronto!

[London](https://www.meetup.com/London-Apache-Beam-Meetup) had its first meetup of 2019 at the start of April:

and [Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/Apache-Beam-Stockholm/events/260634514) had its second meetup at the start of May:

Keep an eye out for a meetup in [Paris](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Apache-Beam-Meetup).

If you are interested in starting your own meetup, feel free [to reach out](https://beam.apache.org/community/contact-us)! Good places to start include our Slack channel, the dev and user mailing lists, or the Apache Beam Twitter.

Even if you canâ€™t travel to these meetups, you can stay informed on the happenings of the community.  The talks and sessions from previous conferences and meetups are archived on the [Apache Beam YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ApacheBeamYT). If you want your session added to the channel, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch! And in case you want to attend the next Beam event in style, you can also order your swag on the [Beam swag store](https://store-beam.myshopify.com)

## Summits
The first summit of the year will be held in Berlin:

## Why community engagement matters
Why we need a strong Apache Beam community:
* We're receiving lots of code contributions and need committers to review those and help onboard new contributors to the project.
* We want people to feel a sense of ownership to the project. By fostering this level of engagement, the work becomes even more exciting.
* A healthy community has a further reach and leads to more growth. More hours can be contributed to the project as we can spread the work and ownership.

Why are we organizing these summits:
* We'd like to give folks a place to meet, congregate, and share ideas.
* We know that offline interactions often changes the nature of the online ones in a positive manner.
* Building an active and diverse community is part of the Apache Way. These summits provide an opportunity for us to engage people from different locations, companies, and backgrounds.
