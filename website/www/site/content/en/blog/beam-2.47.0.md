<!--more-->

For more information on changes in 2.47.0, check out the [detailed release notes](https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/10).

## Highlights

* Apache Beam adds Python 3.11 support ([#23848](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23848)).

## I/Os

* BigQuery Storage Write API is now available in Python SDK via cross-language ([#21961](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21961)).
* Added HbaseIO support for writing RowMutations (ordered by rowkey) to Hbase (Java) ([#25830](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25830)).
* Added fileio transforms MatchFiles, MatchAll and ReadMatches (Go) ([#25779](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25779)).
* Add integration test for JmsIO + fix issue with multiple connections (Java) ([#25887](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25887)).

## New Features / Improvements

* The Flink runner now supports Flink 1.16.x ([#25046](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25046)).
* Schema'd PTransforms can now be directly applied to Beam dataframes just like PCollections.
  (Note that when doing multiple operations, it may be more efficient to explicitly chain the operations
  like `df | (Transform1 | Transform2 | ...)` to avoid excessive conversions.)
* The Go SDK adds new transforms periodic.Impulse and periodic.Sequence that extends support
  for slowly updating side input patterns. ([#23106](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23106))
* Several Google client libraries in Python SDK dependency chain were updated to latest available major versions. ([#24599](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/24599))

## Breaking Changes

* If a main session fails to load, the pipeline will now fail at worker startup. ([#25401](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25401)).
* Python pipeline options will now ignore unparsed command line flags prefixed with a single dash. ([#25943](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25943)).
* The SmallestPerKey combiner now requires keyword-only arguments for specifying optional parameters, such as `key` and `reverse`. ([#25888](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25888)).

## Deprecations

* Cloud Debugger support and its pipeline options are deprecated and will be removed in the next Beam version,
  in response to the Google Cloud Debugger service [turning down](https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/deprecations). (Java) ([#25959](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25959)).

## Bugfixes

* BigQuery sink in STORAGE_WRITE_API mode in batch pipelines might result in data consistency issues during the handling of other unrelated transient errors for Beam SDKs 2.35.0 - 2.46.0 (inclusive). For more details see: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26521

### Known Issues

* BigQueryIO Storage API write with autoUpdateSchema may cause data corruption for Beam SDKs 2.45.0 - 2.47.0 (inclusive) ([#26789](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26789))
