For more information about changes in 2.58.0, check out the [detailed release notes](https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/22).

## I/Os

* Support for [Solace](https://solace.com/) source (`SolaceIO.Read`) added (Java) ([#31440](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31440)).

## New Features / Improvements

* Multiple RunInference instances can now share the same model instance by setting the model_identifier parameter (Python) ([#31665](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31665)).
* Added options to control the number of Storage API multiplexing connections ([#31721](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/31721))
* [BigQueryIO] Better handling for batch Storage Write API when it hits AppendRows throughput quota ([#31837](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/31837))
* [IcebergIO] All specified catalog properties are passed through to the connector ([#31726](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/31726))
* Removed a third-party LGPL dependency from the Go SDK ([#31765](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31765)).
* Support for `MapState` and `SetState` when using Dataflow Runner v1 with Streaming Engine (Java) ([[#18200](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/18200)])

## Breaking Changes

* [IcebergIO] `IcebergCatalogConfig` was changed to support specifying catalog properties in a key-store fashion ([#31726](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/31726))
* [SpannerIO] Added validation that query and table cannot be specified at the same time for `SpannerIO.read()`. Previously `withQuery` overrides `withTable`, if set ([#24956](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/24956)).

## Bug fixes

* [BigQueryIO] Fixed a bug in batch Storage Write API that frequently exhausted concurrent connections quota ([#31710](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/31710))

## Known Issues

* Python pipelines that run with 2.53.0-2.58.0 SDKs and read data from GCS might be affected by a data corruption issue ([#32169](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32169)). The issue will be fixed in 2.59.0 ([#32135](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32135)). To work around this, update the google-cloud-storage package to version 2.18.2 or newer.
* [KafkaIO] Records read with `ReadFromKafkaViaSDF` are redistributed and may contain duplicates regardless of the configuration. This affects Java pipelines with Dataflow v2 runner and xlang pipelines reading from Kafka, ([#32196](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32196))
