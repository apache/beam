We are happy to present the new 2.33.0 release of Beam.
This release includes both improvements and new functionality.
See the [download page](/get-started/downloads/#2330-2021-10-07) for this release.

For more information on changes in 2.33.0, check out the [detailed release
notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319527&version=12350404).

## Highlights

* Go SDK is no longer experimental, and is officially part of the Beam release process.
  * Matching Go SDK containers are published on release.
  * Batch usage is well supported, and tested on Flink, Spark, and the Python Portable Runner.
    * SDK Tests are also run against Google Cloud Dataflow, but this doesn't indicate reciprocal support.
  * The SDK supports Splittable DoFns, Cross Language transforms, and most Beam Model basics.
  * Go Modules are now used for dependency management.
    * This is a breaking change, see Breaking Changes for resolution.
    * Easier path to contribute to the Go SDK, no need to set up a GO\_PATH.
    * Minimum Go version is now Go v1.16
  * See the announcement blogpost for full information once published.

### New Features / Improvements

* Projection pushdown in SchemaIO ([BEAM-12609](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12609)).
* Upgrade Flink runner to Flink versions 1.13.2, 1.12.5 and 1.11.4 ([BEAM-10955](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10955)).

### Breaking Changes

* Since release 2.30.0, "The AvroCoder changes for BEAM-2303 \[changed\] the reader/writer from the Avro ReflectDatum* classes to the SpecificDatum* classes" (Java). This default behavior change has been reverted in this release. Use the `useReflectApi` setting to control it ([BEAM-12628](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12628)).

### Deprecations

* Python GBK will stop supporting unbounded PCollections that have global windowing and a default trigger in Beam 2.34. This can be overriden with `--allow_unsafe_triggers`. ([BEAM-9487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9487)).
* Python GBK will start requiring safe triggers or the `--allow_unsafe_triggers` flag starting with Beam 2.34. ([BEAM-9487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9487)).

### Bugfixes

* UnsupportedOperationException when reading from BigQuery tables and converting
  TableRows to Beam Rows (Java)
  ([BEAM-12479](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12479)).
* SDFBoundedSourceReader behaves much slower compared with the original behavior
  of BoundedSource (Python)
  ([BEAM-12781](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12781)).
* ORDER BY column not in SELECT crashes (ZetaSQL)
  ([BEAM-12759](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12759)).

### Known Issues

* Spark 2.x users will need to update Spark's Jackson runtime dependencies (`spark.jackson.version`) to at least version 2.9.2, due to Beam updating its dependencies.
* See a full list of open [issues that affect](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20BEAM%20AND%20affectedVersion%20%3D%202.33.0%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC) this version.
* Go SDK jobs may produce "Failed to deduce Step from MonitoringInfo" messages following successful job execution. The messages are benign and don't indicate job failure. These are due to not yet handling PCollection metrics.
