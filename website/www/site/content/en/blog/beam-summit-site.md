We are thrilled to announce the launch of our new website dedicated to Beam Summits!

The [beamsummit.org](https://beamsummit.org) site provides all the information you need towards the upcoming Beam Summits in Europe, Asia and North America in 2019. You will find information about the conference theme, the speakers and sessions, the abstract submission timeline and the registration process, the conference venues and hosting cities - and much more that you will find useful until and during the Beam Summits 2019.

We are working to make the website easy to use, so that anyone who is organizing a Beam event can rely on it. You can find the [code for it in Github](https://github.com/matthiasa4/hoverboard).

The pages will be updated on a regular basis, but we also love hearing thoughts from our community! Let us know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions, and help us improve! Also, if you are thinking of organizing a Beam event, please feel free to reach out for support, and to use the code in GitHub as well.

We sincerely hope that you like the new Beam Summit website and will find it useful for accessing information. Enjoy browsing around!

See you in Berlin!

#beamsummit2019.
