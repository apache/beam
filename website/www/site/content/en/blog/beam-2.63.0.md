We are happy to present the new 2.63.0 release of Beam.
This release includes both improvements and new functionality.
See the [download page](/get-started/downloads/{$DOWNLOAD_ANCHOR}) for this release.

For more information on changes in 2.63.0, check out the [detailed release notes](https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/27).

## I/Os

* Support gcs-connector 3.x+ in GcsUtil ([#33368](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33368))
* Support for X source added (Java/Python) ([#X](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/X)).
* Introduced `--groupFilesFileLoad` pipeline option to mitigate side-input related issues in BigQueryIO
  batch FILE_LOAD on certain runners (including Dataflow Runner V2) (Java) ([#33587](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33587)).

## New Features / Improvements

* Add BigQuery vector/embedding ingestion and enrichment components to apache_beam.ml.rag (Python) ([#33413](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33413)).
* Upgraded to protobuf 4 (Java) ([#33192](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33192)).
* [GCSIO] Added retry logic to each batch method of the GCS IO (Python) ([#33539](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33539))
* [GCSIO] Enable recursive deletion for GCSFileSystem Paths (Python) ([#33611](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33611)).
* External, Process based Worker Pool support added to the Go SDK container. ([#33572](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33572))
  * This is used to enable sidecar containers to run SDK workers for some runners.
  * See https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/sdk-harness-config/ for details.
* Support the Process Environment for execution in the Go SDK. ([#33651](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33651))
* Prism
  * Prism now uses the same single port for both pipeline submission and execution on workers. Requests are differentiated by worker-id. ([#33438](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33438))
    * This avoids port starvation and provides clarity on port use when running Prism in non-local environments.
  * Support for @RequiresTimeSortedInputs added. ([#33513](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33513))
  * Initial support for AllowedLateness added. ([#33542](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33542))
  * The Go SDK's inprocess Prism runner (AKA the Go SDK default runner) now supports non-loopback mode environment types. ([#33572](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33572))
  * Support the Process Environment for execution in Prism ([#33651](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33651))
  * Support the AnyOf Environment for execution in Prism ([#33705](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33705))
     * This improves support for developing Xlang pipelines, when using a compatible cross language service.
* Partitions are now configurable for the DaskRunner in the Python SDK ([#33805](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33805)).
* [Dataflow Streaming] Enable Windmill GetWork Response Batching by default ([#33847](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33847)).
  * With this change user workers will request batched GetWork responses from backend and backend will send multiple WorkItems in the same response proto.
  * The feature can be disabled by passing `--windmillRequestBatchedGetWorkResponse=false`

## Breaking Changes

* AWS V1 I/Os have been removed (Java). As part of this, x-lang Python Kinesis I/O has been updated to consume the V2 IO and it also no longer supports setting producer_properties ([#33430](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33430)).
* Upgraded to protobuf 4 (Java) ([#33192](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33192)), but forced Debezium IO to use protobuf 3 ([#33541](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33541) because Debezium clients are not protobuf 4 compatible. This may cause conflicts when using clients which are only compatible with protobuf 4.
* Minimum Go version for Beam Go updated to 1.22.10 ([#33609](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33609))

## Bugfixes

* Fix data loss issues when reading gzipped files with TextIO (Python) ([#18390](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/18390), [#31040](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31040)).
* [BigQueryIO] Fixed an issue where Storage Write API sometimes doesn't pick up auto-schema updates ([#33231](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33231))
* Prism
  * Fixed an edge case where Bundle Finalization might not become enabled. ([#33493](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33493)).
  * Fixed session window aggregation, which wasn't being performed per-key. ([#33542](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33542)).)
* [Dataflow Streaming Appliance] Fixed commits failing with KeyCommitTooLargeException when a key outputs >180MB of results. [#33588](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33588).
* Fixed a Dataflow template creation issue that ignores template file creation errors (Java) ([#33636](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33636))
* Correctly documented Pane Encodings in the portability protocols ([#33840](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/33840)).
* Fixed the user mailing list address ([#26013](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26013)).
* [Dataflow Streaming] Fixed an issue where Dataflow Streaming workers were reporting lineage metrics as cumulative rather than delta. ([#33691](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33691))

## Known Issues

* (Java) Current version of protobuf has a [bug](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/20599) leading to incompatibilities with clients using older versions of Protobuf ([example issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/issues/2191)). This issue has been seen in SpannerIO in particular. Tracked in [#34452](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/issues/34452)
