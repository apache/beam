We are happy to present the new 2.50.0 release of Beam.
This release includes both improvements and new functionality.
See the [download page](/get-started/downloads/#2500-2023-08-30) for this release.

For more information on changes in 2.50.0, check out the [detailed release notes](https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/14).

## Highlights

* Spark 3.2.2 is used as default version for Spark runner ([#23804](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23804)).
* The Go SDK has a new default local runner, called Prism ([#24789](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/24789)).
* All Beam released container images are now [multi-arch images](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/build-multi-arch-for-arm#what_is_a_multi-arch_image) that support both x86 and ARM CPU architectures.

## I/Os

* Java KafkaIO now supports picking up topics via topicPattern ([#26948](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/26948))
* Support for read from Cosmos DB Core SQL API ([#23604](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23604))
* Upgraded to HBase 2.5.5 for HBaseIO. (Java) ([#27711](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/19554))
* Added support for GoogleAdsIO source (Java) ([#27681](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27681)).

## New Features / Improvements

* The Go SDK now requires Go 1.20 to build. ([#27558](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/27558))
* The Go SDK has a new default local runner, Prism. ([#24789](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/24789)).
  * Prism is a portable runner that executes each transform independantly, ensuring coders.
  * At this point it supercedes the Go direct runner in functionality. The Go direct runner is now deprecated.
  * See https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/go/pkg/beam/runners/prism/README.md for the goals and features of Prism.
* Hugging Face Model Handler for RunInference added to Python SDK. ([#26632](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/26632))
* Hugging Face Pipelines support for RunInference added to Python SDK. ([#27399](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27399))
* Vertex AI Model Handler for RunInference now supports private endpoints ([#27696](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27696))
* MLTransform transform added with support for common ML pre/postprocessing operations ([#26795](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/26795))
* Upgraded the Kryo extension for the Java SDK to Kryo 5.5.0. This brings in bug fixes, performance improvements, and serialization of Java 14 records. ([#27635](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/27635))
* All Beam released container images are now [multi-arch images](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/build-multi-arch-for-arm#what_is_a_multi-arch_image) that support both x86 and ARM CPU architectures. ([#27674](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/27674)). The multi-arch container images include:
  * All versions of Go, Python, Java and Typescript SDK containers.
  * All versions of Flink job server containers.
  * Java and Python expansion service containers.
  * Transform service controller container.
  * Spark3 job server container.
* Added support for batched writes to AWS SQS for improved throughput (Java, AWS 2).([#21429](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21429))

## Breaking Changes

* Python SDK: Legacy runner support removed from Dataflow, all pipelines must use runner v2.
* Python SDK: Dataflow Runner will no longer stage Beam SDK from PyPI in the `--staging_location` at pipeline submission. Custom container images that are not based on Beam's default image must include Apache Beam installation.([#26996](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26996))

## Deprecations

* The Go Direct Runner is now Deprecated. It remains available to reduce migration churn.
  * Tests can be set back to the direct runner by overriding TestMain: `func TestMain(m *testing.M) { ptest.MainWithDefault(m, "direct") }`
  * It's recommended to fix issues seen in tests using Prism, as they can also happen on any portable runner.
  * Use the generic register package for your pipeline DoFns to ensure pipelines function on portable runners, like prism.
  * Do not rely on closures or using package globals for DoFn configuration. They don't function on portable runners.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed DirectRunner bug in Python SDK where GroupByKey gets empty PCollection and fails when pipeline option `direct_num_workers!=1`.([#27373](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27373))
* Fixed BigQuery I/O bug when estimating size on queries that utilize row-level security ([#27474](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27474))
* Beam Python containers rely on a version of Debian/aom that has several security vulnerabilities: [CVE-2021-30474](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30474), [CVE-2021-30475](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30475), [CVE-2021-30473](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30473), [CVE-2020-36133](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36133), [CVE-2020-36131](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36131), [CVE-2020-36130](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36130), and [CVE-2020-36135](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36135).

## Known Issues

* Long-running Python pipelines might experience a memory leak: [#28246](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/28246).
* Python Pipelines using BigQuery IO or `orjson` dependency might experience segmentation faults or get stuck: [#28318](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/28318).
