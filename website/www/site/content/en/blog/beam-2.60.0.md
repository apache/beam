For more information on changes in 2.60.0, check out the [detailed release notes](https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/24).

## Highlights

* Added support for using vLLM in the RunInference transform (Python) ([#32528](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32528))
* [Managed Iceberg] Added support for streaming writes ([#32451](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32451))
* [Managed Iceberg] Added auto-sharding for streaming writes ([#32612](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32612))
* [Managed Iceberg] Added support for writing to dynamic destinations ([#32565](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32565))

## New Features / Improvements

* Dataflow worker can install packages from Google Artifact Registry Python repositories (Python) ([#32123](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32123)).
* Added support for Zstd codec in SerializableAvroCodecFactory (Java) ([#32349](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32349))
* Added support for using vLLM in the RunInference transform (Python) ([#32528](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32528))
* Prism release binaries and container bootloaders are now being built with the latest Go 1.23 patch. ([#32575](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32575))
* Prism
  * Prism now supports Bundle Finalization. ([#32425](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32425))
* Significantly improved performance of Kafka IO reads that enable [commitOffsetsInFinalize](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.Read.html#commitOffsetsInFinalize--) by removing the data reshuffle from SDF implementation.  ([#31682](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/31682)).
* Added support for dynamic writing in MqttIO (Java) ([#19376](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/19376))
* Optimized Spark Runner parDo transform evaluator (Java) ([#32537](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32537))
* [Managed Iceberg] More efficient manifest file writes/commits ([#32666](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32666))

## Breaking Changes

* In Python, assert_that now throws if it is not in a pipeline context instead of silently succeeding ([#30771](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/30771))
* In Python and YAML, ReadFromJson now override the dtype from None to
  an explicit False.  Most notably, string values like `"123"` are preserved
  as strings rather than silently coerced (and possibly truncated) to numeric
  values.  To retain the old behavior, pass `dtype=True` (or any other value
  accepted by `pandas.read_json`).
* Users of KafkaIO  Read transform that enable [commitOffsetsInFinalize](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.Read.html#commitOffsetsInFinalize--) might encounter pipeline graph  compatibility issues when updating the pipeline. To mitigate, set the `updateCompatibilityVersion` option to the SDK version used for the original pipeline, example `--updateCompatabilityVersion=2.58.1`

## Deprecations

* Python 3.8 is reaching EOL and support is being removed in Beam 2.61.0. The 2.60.0 release will warn users
when running on 3.8. ([#31192](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31192))

## Bugfixes

* (Java) Fixed custom delimiter issues in TextIO ([#32249](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32249), [#32251](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32251)).
* (Java, Python, Go) Fixed PeriodicSequence backlog bytes reporting, which was preventing Dataflow Runner autoscaling from functioning properly ([#32506](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32506)).
* (Java) Fix improper decoding of rows with schemas containing nullable fields when encoded with a schema with equal encoding positions but modified field order. ([#32388](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32388)).
