We are so excited to announce the upcoming Beam events for this year! We believe that events are an important mechanism to foster the community around Apache Beam as an Open Source Project. Our events are focused on a developer experience by giving spaces for the community to connect, facilitate collaboration, and enable knowledge sharing.

Here is an overview of some upcoming events and ways for everyone to help foster additional community growth:

## Beam Summit

The **[Beam Summit 2022](https://2022.beamsummit.org/)** is approaching! The event will be in a hybrid in-person and virtual format from Austin, TX on July 18-20, 2022. The conference will include three full days of lightning talks, roadmap updates, use cases, demos, and workshops for Beam users of all levels. This is a great opportunity to collaborate, share ideas, and work together in the improvement of the project.
