## AvgInputThroughputBytesPerSec

The mean input throughput of the pipeline Job measured in bytes per second.

## AvgInputThroughputElementsPerSec

The mean elements input throughput per second of the pipeline Job.

## AvgOutputThroughputBytesPerSec

The mean output throughput of the pipeline Job measured in bytes per second.

## AvgOutputThroughputElementsPerSec

The mean elements output throughput per second of the pipeline Job.

## EstimatedCost

The estimated cost of the pipeline Job.

## RunTime

The time it took for the pipeline Job to run measured in seconds.
