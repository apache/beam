# Become a Beam Committer

An Apache Beam [committer](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#committers) takes many forms. There are many actions other than coding that build the trust we place in a committer - code review, design discussion, user support, community outreach, improving infrastructure, documentation, project management, etc.

### What does it mean being a commiter?

An Apache Beam committer has write access to the repository for merging pull requests, but you don’t have to be a code contributor to become a committer. Becoming a committer means that you have the project’s trust. Read the [ASF documentation](https://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html#committer-responsibilities) for more about being a committer in the Apache Software Foundation.

The [PMC](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc-members) makes someone a committer via nomination, discussion, and then majority vote. We use data from as many sources as possible to inform our reasoning.
