# Case Study

Your company uses Apache Beam? There are several options to highlight it and make your company stand out!

## Share your story

Sharing your story and making a Case Study out of it might have a significant impact on helping users with adopting Apache Beam. And, of course, gaining interest for your company. Please see [how to add a new case study](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/website/ADD_CASE_STUDY.md) for the next steps, templates and helpful tips. If you have any questions about adding a case study, please [contact the community](mailto:dev@beam.apache.org?subject=Beam%20Website%20Add%20New%20Case%20Study).

## Add your logo

Want to tell the world you are using Apache Beam? Just walk
through [this instruction](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/website/ADD_LOGO.md) and make it happen!

The Apache Beam PMC reserves the right to remove logos of companies that are not deemed to be in good standing in the
community.
