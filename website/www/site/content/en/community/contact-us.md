# Contact us!

The Apache Beam community is friendly and welcoming. We are glad to help with any
questions, suggestions, or ideas you have. Contact us in the following channels:

## Available contact channels

{{< community/table_with_icons contact_us >}}

## Mailing list, what are they and how they work

The official communication channels for Apache projects are their [mailing lists](https://community.apache.org/lists.html), and Apache Beam has two main lists: [user@beam.apache.org](mailto:user@beam.apache.org) and [dev@beam.apache.org](mailto:dev@beam.apache.org). The topics for each of them can be seen in the section above.

### Subscribe and Unsubscribe:

Prior to sending emails to these lists, you need to subscribe. To subscribe, send a blank email to [user-subscribe@beam.apache.org](mailto:user-subscribe@beam.apache.org) or [dev-subscribe@beam.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@beam.apache.org) depending on the list you want to write to.

After you subscribe, you’ll receive all emails going to this mailing list. If you no longer wish to receive emails from these lists, you need to send another blank email to either  [user-unsubscribe@beam.apache.org](mailto:user-subscribe@beam.apache.org) or [dev-unsubscribe@beam.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@beam.apache.org).

### Useful Tips for Sending Emails

Tip 1: Use tags in your subject line.
A tag is a word within a pair of brackets [] that indicate the type of message you’re sending. For example: [Bug] or [Proposal] or [Question] or [Idea]. Tags help folks navigate emails easier.

Tip 2: If you’re asking a troubleshooting question, provide as much information as possible to help others replicate your issue or find possible solutions.
