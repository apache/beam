# Contact us!

The Apache Beam community is friendly and welcoming. We are glad to help with any
question, suggestion or idea you have. Contact us in the following channels:

## Available contact channels

{{< community/table_with_icons contact_us >}}

## Mailing list, what are they and how they work

The official communication channels for Apache projects are their mailing lists, and Apache Beam has two main lists: [user@beam.apache.org](user@beam.apache.org) and [dev@beam.apache.org](dev@beam.apache.org). The topics for each of them can be seen in the section above.

### Subsribe and Unsubscribe:

Prior to sending emails to these lists, you need to subscribe. To subscribe, send a blank email to [user-subscribe@beam.apache.org](user-subscribe@beam.apache.org) or [dev-subscribe@beam.apache.org](dev-subscribe@beam.apache.org) depending on the list you want to write to.

To unsubscribe, send a blank email to [user-unsubscribe@beam.apache.org](user-unsubscribe@beam.apache.org) or [dev-unsubscribe@beam.apache.org](dev-unsubscribe@beam.apache.org) depending on the list you want to unsubscribe.

### Useful Tips for Sending Emails

Tip 1: Use tags in your subject line.
A tag is a word within a pair of brackets [] that indicate the type of message you’re sending. For example: [Bug] or [Proposal] or [Question] or [Idea]. Tags help folks navigate emails easier.

Tip 2: If you’re asking a troubleshooting question, provide as much information as possible to help others replicate your issue or find possible solutions.

Tip 3: Share complete links instead of hyperlinks. A common practice in Apache is adding a number tag like [1] to indicate a word is a link or an attachment, and use the tag as a footnote to add the complete link at the end of your message.
