# Go SDK Roadmap

The Go SDK is [fully released as of v2.33.0](/blog/go-sdk-release/).

The Go SDK the first SDK purely on the [Beam Portability Framework](/roadmap/portability/)
and can execute pipelines on portable runners, like Flink, Spark, Samza, and Google Cloud Dataflow.

Current roadmap:
* continue building up unbounded pipeline facing features, as described on the [Beam Dev Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Supporting+Streaming+in+the+Go+SDK).
* improve IO support via cross language transforms, and add scalable native transforms. [Go SDK Connector Roadmap](/roadmap/connectors-go-sdk/)

Otherwise, improving examples and documentation for devs and users alike is ongoing.
Contributions are welcome. Please contact the [dev list](mailto:dev@beam.apache.org?subject=%5BGo%20SDK%5D%20How%20can%20I%20help%3F)
for assistance in finding a place to help out.

 - Contact: Robert Burke (@lostluck) [Email](mailto:lostluck@apache.org?subject=%5BGo%20SDK%20Roadmap%5D) - Please also cc the dev@beam.apache.org list. I strongly prefer public discussion of Go SDK matters.
