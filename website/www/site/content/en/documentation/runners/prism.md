# Overview

The Apache Beam Prism Runner can be used to execute Beam pipelines locally using [Beam Portability](/roadmap/portability/).

The Prism runner is suitable for small scale local testing and provides:

* A statically compiled, single binary for simple deployment without additional configuration.
* A web UI when executing in stand alone mode.
* A direct implementation of Beam execution semantics.
* A streaming-first runtime that supports batch processing and data streaming programs.
* Fast, in-memory execution for to simplify SDK, Transform, and Pipeline development. 
* Cross Language Transform support.

Written in [Go](https://go.dev), it is the default runner for the [Go SDK](/roadmap/go-sdk/), but can be used in other SDKs as well (see below).

# Using the Prism Runner
 
{{< language-switcher go java py >}}

<span class="language-go">Prism is the default runner for the Go SDK and is used automatically. Set the runner with the flag `--runner=PrismRunner`. </span>
<span class="language-java">Set the runner to `PrismRunner`. </span>
<span class="language-py">Set the runner to `PrismRunner`. </span>

For other SDKs, Prism is included as an asset on [Beam Github Releases](https://github.com/apache/beam/releases/tag/v{{< param release_latest >}}) for download and stand alone use.

Here are some resources with information about how to test your pipelines.
<ul>
  <li><a href="/documentation/pipelines/test-your-pipeline/">Test Your Pipeline</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="/get-started/wordcount-example/#testing-your-pipeline-with-asserts">Apache Beam WordCount Walkthrough</a> contains an example of logging and testing a pipeline with asserts.
  <!-- Java specific links -->
  <li class="language-java"><a href="/blog/2016/10/20/test-stream.html">Testing Unbounded Pipelines in Apache Beam</a> talks about the use of Java classes <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/{{< param release_latest >}}/index.html?org/apache/beam/sdk/testing/PAssert.html">PAssert</a> and <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/{{< param release_latest >}}/index.html?org/apache/beam/sdk/testing/TestStream.html">TestStream</a> to test your pipelines.</li>
</ul>

### Specify your dependency

<span class="language-java">When using Java, you must specify your dependency on the Direct Runner in your `pom.xml`.</span>
{{< highlight java >}}
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
   <artifactId>beam-runners-prism-java</artifactId>
   <version>{{< param release_latest >}}</version>
   <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
{{< /highlight >}}

<span class="language-py">This section is not applicable to the Beam SDK for Python. Prism is built in.</span>
<span class="language-go">This section is not applicable to the Beam SDK for Go. Prism is built in.</span>

Except for the Go SDK, Prism is included as an asset on [Beam Github Releases](https://github.com/apache/beam/releases/tag/v{{< param release_latest >}}) for automatic download, startup, and shutdown on SDKs.
The binary is cached locally for subsequent executions.

## Pipeline options for the Prism Runner

Prism aims to have minimal configuration required, and does not currently present user pipeline options.

## Running Prism Standalone

Prism can be executed as a stand alone binary and will present a basic UI for listing jobs, and job status.

It's recommended to use a released version of Prism, such as downloading one from the [Github Release](\(https://github.com/apache/beam/releases/tag/v{{< param release_latest >}})), or to build one from the latest version of the Beam Go module, using a [recent version of Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

```
go run github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/cmd/prism@latest
```

In either case, Prism serves a JobManagement API endpoint, and a Webpage UI locally.
Jobs can be submitted using `--runner=PortableRunner --endpoint=<endpoint address>` and monitored using the webpage UI.
