# ML Dependency Extras

In order to make it easy to make sure you are using dependencies which have
been well tested with Beam ML, Beam provides a set of ML extras which can
be installed alongside of Beam. For example, if you want to use a version
of PyTorch which has been tested with Beam, you can install it with:

```
pip install beam[torch]
```

A full set of extras can be found in
[setup.py](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/6e3cf2b113026e27db7833a1f0fd08977b7c71e1/sdks/python/setup.py#L397).

**Note:** You can also pin to dependencies outside of the extra range with
a normal install - for example:

```
pip install beam==2.XX.0
pip install torch==<version released after Beam 2.XX.0>
```

this will usually work, but can break if the dependency releases a breaking
change between the version Beam tests with and the version you pin to.
