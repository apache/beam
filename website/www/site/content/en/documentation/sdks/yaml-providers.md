# Providers

Though we aim to offer a large suite of built-in transforms, it is inevitable
that people will need to author their own. This is made possible
through the notion of Providers which leverage expansion services and
vend catalogues of schema transforms.

## Java

For example, you could build a jar that vends a
[cross language transform](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-multi-language-pipelines/)
or [schema transform](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/schemas/transforms/SchemaTransformProvider.html)
and then use it in a transform as follows

```
pipeline:
  type: chain
  source:
    type: ReadFromCsv
    config:
      path: /path/to/input*.csv

  transforms:
    - type: MyCustomTransform
      config:
        arg: whatever

  sink:
    type: WriteToJson
    config:
      path: /path/to/output.json

providers:
  - type: javaJar
    config:
       jar: /path/or/url/to/myExpansionService.jar
    transforms:
       MyCustomTransform: "urn:registered:in:expansion:service"
```

A full example of how to build a java provider can be found
[here](https://github.com/apache/beam-starter-java-provider).

## Python

Arbitrary Python transforms can be provided as well, using the syntax

```
providers:
  - type: pythonPackage
    config:
       packages:
           - my_pypi_package>=version
           - /path/to/local/package.zip
    transforms:
       MyCustomTransform: "pkg.module.PTransformClassOrCallable"
```

We offer a [python provider starter project](https://github.com/apache/beam-starter-python-provider)
that serves as a complete example for how to do this.

## YAML Provider listing files

One can reference an external listings of providers in the yaml pipeline file
via the syntax

```
providers:
  - include: "file:///path/to/local/providers.yaml"
  - include: "gs://path/to/remote/providers.yaml"
  - include: "https://example.com/hosted/providers.yaml"
  ...
```

where `providers.yaml` is simply a yaml file containing a list of providers
in the same format as those inlined in this providers block.
See, for example, the provider listing [here](
https://github.com/apache/beam-starter-python-provider/blob/main/examples/provider_listing.yaml).

In fact, this is how many of the the built in transforms are declared,
see for example the [builtin io listing file](
https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/yaml/standard_io.yaml).

Hosting these listing files (together with their required artifacts) allows
one to easily share catalogues of transforms that can be directly used
by others in their YAML pipelines.
