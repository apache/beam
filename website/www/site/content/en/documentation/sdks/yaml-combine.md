# Beam YAML Aggregations

Beam YAML has EXPERIMENTAL ability to do aggregations to group and combine
values across records. The is accomplished via the `Combine` transform type.
Currently `Combine` needs to be in the `yaml_experimental_features`
option to use this transform.

For example, one can write

```
- type: Combine
  config:
    group_by: col1
    combine:
      total:
        value: col2
        fn:
          type: sum
```

If the function has no configuration requirements, it can be provided directly
as a string

```
- type: Combine
  config:
    group_by: col1
    combine:
      total:
        value: col2
        fn: sum
```

This can be simplified further if the output field name is the same as the input
field name

```
- type: Combine
  config:
    group_by: col1
    combine:
      col2: sum
```

One can aggregate over may fields at once

```
- type: Combine
  config:
    group_by: col1
    combine:
      col2: sum
      col3: max
```

and/or group by more than one field

```
- type: Combine
  config:
    group_by: [col1, col2]
    combine:
      col3: sum
```

or none at all (which will result in a global combine with a single output)

```
- type: Combine
  config:
    group_by: []
    combine:
      col2: sum
      col3: max
```

## Windowed aggregation

As with all transforms, `Combine` can take a windowing parameter

```
- type: Combine
  windowing:
    type: fixed
    size: 60
  config:
    group_by: col1
    combine:
      col2: sum
      col3: max
```

If no windowing specification is provided, it inherits the windowing
parameters from upstream, e.g.

```
- type: WindowInto
  windowing:
    type: fixed
    size: 60
- type: Combine
  config:
    group_by: col1
    combine:
      col2: sum
      col3: max
```

is equivalent to the previous example.


## Custom aggregation functions

One can use aggregation functions defined in Python by setting the language
parameter.

```
- type: Combine
  config:
    language: python
    group_by: col1
    combine:
      biggest:
        value: "col2 + col2"
        fn:
          type: 'apache_beam.transforms.combiners.TopCombineFn'
          config:
            n: 10
```

## SQL-style aggregations

By setting the language to SQL, one can provide full SQL snippets as the
combine fn.

```
- type: Combine
  config:
    language: sql
    group_by: col1
    combine:
      num_values: "count(*)"
      total: "sum(col2)"
```

One can of course also use the `Sql` transform type and provide a query
directly.
