# Beam SDK for Go dependencies

Beam Go uses [Go modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) for package management.
Compile and runtime dependencies for your Beam SDK version are listed in `go.sum` in the Beam repository.
This can be found at

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/v<VERSION_NUMBER>/sdks/go.sum
```

<p class="paragraph-wrap">Replace `<VERSION_NUMBER>` with the major.minor.patch version of the SDK. For example, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/v{{< param release_latest >}}/sdks/go.sum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/v{{< param release_latest >}}/sdks/go.sum</a> will provide the dependencies for the {{< param release_latest >}} release.</p>

**Note:** To just view direct dependencies, you can view the `go.mod` file instead, direct dependencies
are listed in the initial `require` statement. This can be found at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/v<VERSION_NUMBER>/sdks/go.mod`
