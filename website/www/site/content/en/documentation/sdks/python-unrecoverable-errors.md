# Unrecoverable Errors in Beam Python

## What is an Unrecoverable Error?

An unrecoverable error is an issue at job start-up time that will
prevent a job from ever running successfully, usually due to some kind
of misconfiguration. Solving these issues when they occur is key to
successfully running a Beam Python pipeline.

## Common Unrecoverable Errors

### Job Submission/Runtime Python Version Mismatch

If the Python version used for job submission does not match the
Python version used to build the worker container, the job will not
execute. Ensure that the Python version being used for job submission
and the container Python version match.

### PIP Dependency Resolution Failures

During worker start-up, dependencies are checked and installed in
the worker container before accepting work. If thereâ€™s an issue during
this process (e.g. a dependency version cannot be found) the worker
will restart and try again up to four times before outright failing.
Ensure that dependency versions provided in your requirements.txt file
exist and can be installed locally before submitting jobs.

### Dependency Verision Mismatches

When additional dependencies like torch, transformers, etc are not
specified via requirements_file or preinstalled with a custom container
then the worker may go into a restart loop trying to install dependencies
again up to 4 times and finally fail. There is a debug log specifying `ModuleNotFoundError`.
A similar outcome is observed when there is a dependency mismatch that
often has `AttributeError` logged in debug mode. Ensure that the required
dependencies at runtime and in the submission environment are the same
along with their versions. For better visibility, debug logs are added
specifying the dependencies at both stages starting in Beam 2.52.0.
