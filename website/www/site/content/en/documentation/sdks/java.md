# Apache Beam Java SDK

The Java SDK for Apache Beam provides a simple, powerful API for building both batch and streaming parallel data processing pipelines in Java.


## Get Started with the Java SDK

Get started with the [Beam Programming Model](/documentation/programming-guide/) to learn the basic concepts that apply to all SDKs in Beam.

See the [Java API Reference](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/) for more information on individual APIs.


## Supported Features

The Java SDK supports all features currently supported by the Beam model.


## Pipeline I/O
See the [Beam-provided I/O Transforms](/documentation/io/built-in/) page for a list of the currently available I/O transforms.


## Extensions

The Java SDK has the following extensions:

- [join-library](/documentation/sdks/java-extensions/#join-library) provides inner join, outer left join, and outer right join functions.
- [sorter](/documentation/sdks/java-extensions/#sorter) is an efficient and scalable sorter for large iterables.
- [Nexmark](/documentation/sdks/java/testing/nexmark) is a benchmark suite that runs in batch and streaming modes.
- [euphoria](/documentation/sdks/java/euphoria) is easy to use Java 8 DSL for BEAM.

In addition several [3rd party Java libraries](/documentation/sdks/java-thirdparty/) exist.

## Java multi-language pipelines quickstart

Apache Beam lets you combine transforms written in any supported SDK language and use them in one multi-language pipeline. To learn how to create a multi-language pipeline using the Java SDK, see the [Java multi-language pipelines quickstart](/documentation/sdks/java-multi-language-pipelines).
