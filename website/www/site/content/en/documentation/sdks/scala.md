# Apache Beam Scala SDK

The official SDK for writing Beam Pipelines in Scala is [Scio](https://spotify.github.io/scio/).

## Scio

Scio is a Scala API for Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow inspired by Apache Spark and Scalding.
Scio aims to be a thin wrapper on top of Beam while offering idiomatic Scala style API.
