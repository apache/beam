# SparkReceiver IO

SparkReceiverIO is a transform for reading data from an Apache Spark Receiver as an unbounded source.

## Spark Receivers support

`SparkReceiverIO` currently supports [Apache Spark Receiver](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/streaming-custom-receivers.html).

Requirements for `Spark Receiver`:
- Version of Spark should be 2.4.*.
- `Spark Receiver` should support work with offsets.
- `Spark Receiver` should implement [HasOffset](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/sparkreceiver/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/sparkreceiver/HasOffset.java) interface.
- Records should have the numeric field that represents record offset.

For more details please see [SparkReceiverIO readme](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/sparkreceiver/2/README.md).

## Streaming reading using SparkReceiverIO

In order to read from `Spark Receiver` you will need to pass:

- `getOffsetFn`, which is `SerializableFunction` that defines how to get `Long` record offset from a record.
- `receiverBuilder`, which is needed for building instances of `Spark Receiver` that use Apache Beam mechanisms instead of Spark environment.

You can easily create `receiverBuilder` object by passing the following parameters:

- Class of your `Spark Receiver`.
- Constructor arguments needed to create an instance of your `Spark Receiver`.

For example:

{{< highlight java >}}
//In this example, MyReceiver accepts a MyConfig object as its only constructor parameter.
MyConfig myPluginConfig = new MyConfig(authToken, apiServerUrl);
Object[] myConstructorArgs = new Object[] {myConfig};
ReceiverBuilder<String, MyReceiver<String>> myReceiverBuilder =
  new ReceiverBuilder<>(MyReceiver.class)
    .withConstructorArgs(myConstructorArgs);
{{< /highlight >}}

Then you will be able to pass this `receiverBuilder` object to `SparkReceiverIO`.

For example:

{{< highlight java >}}
SparkReceiverIO.Read<String> readTransform =
  SparkReceiverIO.<String>read()
    .withGetOffsetFn(Long::valueOf)
    .withSparkReceiverBuilder(myReceiverBuilder)
p.apply("readFromMyReceiver", readTransform);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Read data with optional parameters

Optionally you can pass the following optional parameters:

- `pullFrequencySec`, which is delay in seconds between polling for new records updates.
- `startOffset`, which is inclusive start offset from which the reading should be started.
- `timestampFn`, which is a `SerializableFunction` that defines how to get an `Instant timestamp` from a record.

For example:

{{< highlight java >}}
SparkReceiverIO.Read<String> readTransform =
  SparkReceiverIO.<String>read()
    .withGetOffsetFn(Long::valueOf)
    .withSparkReceiverBuilder(myReceiverBuilder)
    .withPullFrequencySec(1L)
    .withStartOffset(1L)
    .withTimestampFn(Instant::parse);
p.apply("readFromReceiver", readTransform);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Examples for specific Spark Receiver

#### CDAP Hubspot Receiver

{{< highlight java >}}
ReceiverBuilder<String, HubspotReceiver<String>> hubspotReceiverBuilder =
  new ReceiverBuilder<>(HubspotReceiver.class)
    .withConstructorArgs(hubspotConfig);
SparkReceiverIO.Read<String> readTransform =
  SparkReceiverIO.<String>read()
    .withGetOffsetFn(GetOffsetUtils.getOffsetFnForHubspot())
    .withSparkReceiverBuilder(hubspotReceiverBuilder)
p.apply("readFromHubspotReceiver", readTransform);
{{< /highlight >}}
