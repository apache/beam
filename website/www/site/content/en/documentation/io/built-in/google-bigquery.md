# Google BigQuery I/O connector

{{< language-switcher java py >}}

The Beam SDKs include built-in transforms that can read data from and write data
to [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) tables.

## BigQuery basics

### Table names

To read or write from a BigQuery table, you must provide a fully-qualified
BigQuery table name (for example, `bigquery-public-data:github_repos.sample_contents`).
A fully-qualified BigQuery table name consists of three parts:

 * **Project ID**: The ID for your Google Cloud Project. The default value comes
   from your pipeline options object.
 * **Dataset ID**: The BigQuery dataset ID, which is unique within a given Cloud
   Project.
 * **Table ID**: A BigQuery table ID, which is unique within a given dataset.

A table name can also include a [table decorator](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/table-decorators)
if you are using [time-partitioned tables](#using-time-partitioning).

To specify a BigQuery table, you can use either the table's fully-qualified name as
a string, or use a
<span class="language-java">
  [TableReference](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/bigquery/v2/java/latest/index.html?com/google/api/services/bigquery/model/TableReference.html)
</span>
<span class="language-py">
  [TableReference](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/blob/master/bigquery/google/cloud/bigquery/table.py#L153)
</span>
object.

#### Using a string

To specify a table with a string, use the format
`[project_id]:[dataset_id].[table_id]` to specify the fully-qualified BigQuery
table name.

{{< highlight java >}}
{{< code_sample "examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/snippets/Snippets.java" BigQueryTableSpec >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_table_spec >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

You can also omit `project_id` and use the `[dataset_id].[table_id]` format. If
you omit the project ID, Beam uses the default project ID from your
<span class="language-java">
  [pipeline options](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/{{< param release_latest >}}/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/gcp/options/GcpOptions.html).
</span>
<span class="language-py">
  [pipeline options](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/{{< param release_latest >}}/apache_beam.options.pipeline_options.html#apache_beam.options.pipeline_options.GoogleCloudOptions).
</span>

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_table_spec_without_project >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Using a TableReference

To specify a table with a `TableReference`, create a new `TableReference` using
the three parts of the BigQuery table name.

{{< highlight java >}}
{{< code_sample "examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/snippets/Snippets.java" BigQueryTableSpecObject >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_table_spec_object >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

<!-- Java specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
The Beam SDK for Java also provides the [`parseTableSpec`](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/{{< param release_latest >}}/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryHelpers.html)
helper method, which constructs a `TableReference` object from a String that
contains the fully-qualified BigQuery table name. However, the static factory
methods for BigQueryIO transforms accept the table name as a String and
construct a `TableReference` object for you.
{{< /paragraph >}}

### Table rows

BigQueryIO read and write transforms produce and consume data as a `PCollection`
of dictionaries, where each element in the `PCollection` represents a single row
in the table.

### Schemas

When writing to BigQuery, you must supply a table schema for the destination
table that you want to write to, unless you specify a [create
disposition](#create-disposition) of `CREATE_NEVER`. [Creating a table
schema](#creating-a-table-schema) covers schemas in more detail.

### Data types

BigQuery supports the following data types: STRING, BYTES, INTEGER, FLOAT,
NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, TIMESTAMP, DATE, TIME, DATETIME and GEOGRAPHY.
All possible values are described at [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types).
BigQueryIO allows you to use all of these data types. The following example
shows the correct format for data types used when reading from and writing to
BigQuery:

{{< highlight java >}}
{{< code_sample "examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/snippets/transforms/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryTableRowCreate.java" bigquery_table_row_create >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_data_types >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

<!-- Java specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
As of Beam 2.7.0, the NUMERIC data type is supported. This data type supports
high-precision decimal numbers (precision of 38 digits, scale of 9 digits).
The GEOGRAPHY data type works with Well-Known Text (See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text)
format for reading and writing to BigQuery.
BigQuery IO requires values of BYTES datatype to be encoded using base64
encoding when writing to BigQuery. When bytes are read from BigQuery they are
returned as base64-encoded strings.

{{< /paragraph >}}

## Reading from BigQuery

BigQueryIO allows you to read from a BigQuery table, or to execute a SQL query
and read the results. By default, Beam invokes a [BigQuery export
request](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data) when you apply a
BigQueryIO read transform. However, the Beam SDK for Java also supports using
the [BigQuery Storage
API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storage) to read directly
from BigQuery storage. See [Using the BigQuery Storage API](#storage-api) for
more information.

> Beamâ€™s use of BigQuery APIs is subject to BigQuery's
> [Quota](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quota-policy)
> and [Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) policies.

<!-- Java specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
The Beam SDK for Java has two BigQueryIO read methods. Both of these methods
allow you to read from a table, or read fields using a query string.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
1. `read(SerializableFunction)` reads Avro-formatted records and uses a
   specified parsing function to parse them into a `PCollection` of custom typed
   objects. Each element in the `PCollection` represents a single row in the
   table. The [example code](#reading-with-a-query-string) for reading with a
   query string shows how to use `read(SerializableFunction)`.

2. `readTableRows` returns a `PCollection` of BigQuery `TableRow`
   objects.  Each element in the `PCollection` represents a single row in the
   table. Integer values in the `TableRow` objects are encoded as strings to
   match BigQuery's exported JSON format. This method is convenient, but can be
   2-3 times slower in performance compared to `read(SerializableFunction)`. The
   [example code](#reading-from-a-table) for reading from a table shows how to
   use `readTableRows`.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
***Note:*** `BigQueryIO.read()` is deprecated as of Beam SDK 2.2.0. Instead, use
`read(SerializableFunction<SchemaAndRecord, T>)` to parse BigQuery rows from
Avro `GenericRecord` into your custom type, or use `readTableRows()` to parse
them into JSON `TableRow` objects.
{{< /paragraph >}}

<!-- Python specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
To read from a BigQuery table using the Beam SDK for Python, apply a `Read`
transform on a `BigQuerySource`. Read returns a `PCollection` of dictionaries,
where each element in the `PCollection` represents a single row in the table.
Integer values in the `TableRow` objects are encoded as strings to match
BigQuery's exported JSON format.
{{< /paragraph >}}


### Reading from a table

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
To read an entire BigQuery table, use the `from` method with a BigQuery table
name. This example uses `readTableRows`.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
To read an entire BigQuery table, use the `table` parameter with the BigQuery
table name.
{{< /paragraph >}}

The following code reads an entire table that contains weather station data and
then extracts the `max_temperature` column.

{{< highlight java >}}
{{< code_sample "examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/snippets/transforms/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryReadFromTable.java" bigquery_read_from_table >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_read_table >}}
{{< /highlight >}}


### Reading with a query string

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
If you don't want to read an entire table, you can supply a query string with
the `fromQuery` method.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
If you don't want to read an entire table, you can supply a query string to
`BigQuerySource` by specifying the `query` parameter.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
The following code uses a SQL query to only read the `max_temperature` column.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< highlight java >}}
{{< code_sample "examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/snippets/transforms/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryReadFromQuery.java" bigquery_read_from_query >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_read_query >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

You can also use BigQuery's standard SQL dialect with a query string, as shown
in the following example:

{{< highlight java >}}
{{< code_sample "examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/snippets/Snippets.java" BigQueryReadQueryStdSQL >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_read_query_std_sql >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Using the BigQuery Storage API {#storage-api}

The [BigQuery Storage API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storage/)
allows you to directly access tables in BigQuery storage, and supports features
such as column selection and predicate filter push-down which can allow more
efficient pipeline execution.

The Beam SDK for Java supports using the BigQuery Storage API when reading from
BigQuery. SDK versions before 2.24.0 support the BigQuery Storage API as an
[experimental feature](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/index.html?org/apache/beam/sdk/annotations/Experimental.html)
and use the pre-GA BigQuery Storage API surface. Callers should migrate
pipelines which use the BigQuery Storage API to use SDK version 2.24.0 or later.

The Beam SDK for Python does not support the BigQuery Storage API. See
[BEAM-10917](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10917)).

#### Updating your code

Use the following methods when you read from a table:

* Required: Specify [withMethod(Method.DIRECT_READ)](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIO.TypedRead.html#withMethod-org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.bigquery.BigQueryIO.TypedRead.Method-) to use the BigQuery Storage API for the read operation.
* Optional: To use features such as [column projection and column filtering](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storage/), you must specify [withSelectedFields](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.17.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIO.TypedRead.html#withSelectedFields-java.util.List-) and [withRowRestriction](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.17.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIO.TypedRead.html#withRowRestriction-java.lang.String-) respectively.

The following code snippet reads from a table. This example is from the [BigQueryTornadoes
example](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/cookbook/BigQueryTornadoes.java).
When the example's read method option is set to `DIRECT_READ`, the pipeline uses
the BigQuery Storage API and column projection to read public samples of weather
data from a BigQuery table. You can view the [full source code on
GitHub](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/cookbook/BigQueryTornadoes.java).

## Writing to BigQuery

BigQueryIO allows you to write to BigQuery tables. If you are using the Beam SDK
for Java, you can also write different rows to different tables.

> BigQueryIO write transforms use APIs that are subject to BigQuery's
> [Quota](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quota-policy) and
> [Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) policies.

When you apply a write transform, you must provide the following information
for the destination table(s):

 * The table name.
 * The destination table's create disposition. The create disposition specifies
   whether the destination table must exist or can be created by the write
   operation.
 * The destination table's write disposition. The write disposition specifies
   whether the data you write will replace an existing table, append rows to an
   existing table, or write only to an empty table.

In addition, if your write operation creates a new BigQuery table, you must also
supply a table schema for the destination table.


### Create disposition

The create disposition controls whether or not your BigQuery write operation
should create a table if the destination table does not exist.

<!-- Java specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
Use `.withCreateDisposition` to specify the create disposition. Valid enum
values are:
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
 * `Write.CreateDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED`: Specifies that the
   write operation should create a new table if one does not exist. If you use
   this value, you must provide a table schema with the `withSchema` method.
   `CREATE_IF_NEEDED` is the default behavior.

 * `Write.CreateDisposition.CREATE_NEVER`: Specifies that a table
   should never be created. If the destination table does not exist, the write
   operation fails.
{{< /paragraph >}}

<!-- Python specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
Use the `create_disposition` parameter to specify the create disposition. Valid
enum values are:
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" wrap="span" >}}
 * `BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED`: Specifies that the write operation
   should create a new table if one does not exist. If you use this value, you
   must provide a table schema. `CREATE_IF_NEEDED` is the default behavior.

 * `BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_NEVER`: Specifies that a table should never be
   created. If the destination table does not exist, the write operation fails.
{{< /paragraph >}}

If you specify `CREATE_IF_NEEDED` as the create disposition and you don't supply
a table schema, the transform might fail at runtime if the destination table does
not exist.


### Write disposition

The write disposition controls how your BigQuery write operation applies to an
existing table.

<!-- Java specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
Use `.withWriteDisposition` to specify the write disposition. Valid enum values
are:
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
 * `Write.WriteDisposition.WRITE_EMPTY`: Specifies that the write
   operation should fail at runtime if the destination table is not empty.
   `WRITE_EMPTY` is the default behavior.

 * `Write.WriteDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE`: Specifies that the write
   operation should replace an existing table. Any existing rows in the
   destination table are removed, and the new rows are added to the table.

 * `Write.WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND`: Specifies that the write
   operation should append the rows to the end of the existing table.
{{< /paragraph >}}

<!-- Python specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
Use the `write_disposition` parameter to specify the write disposition. Valid
enum values are:
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" wrap="span" >}}
 * `BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_EMPTY`: Specifies that the write operation should
   fail at runtime if the destination table is not empty. `WRITE_EMPTY` is the
   default behavior.

 * `BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE`: Specifies that the write operation
   should replace an existing table. Any existing rows in the destination table
   are removed, and the new rows are added to the table.

 * `BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND`: Specifies that the write operation should
   append the rows to the end of the existing table.
{{< /paragraph >}}

When you use `WRITE_EMPTY`, the check for whether or not the destination table
is empty can occur before the actual write operation. This check doesn't
guarantee that your pipeline will have exclusive access to the table. Two
concurrent pipelines that write to the same output table with a write
disposition of `WRITE_EMPTY` might start successfully, but both pipelines can
fail later when the write attempts happen.


### Creating a table schema

If your BigQuery write operation creates a new table, you must provide schema
information. The schema contains information about each field in the table.

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
To create a table schema in Java, you can either use a `TableSchema` object, or
use a string that contains a JSON-serialized `TableSchema` object.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
To create a table schema in Python, you can either use a `TableSchema` object,
or use a string that defines a list of fields. Single string based schemas do
not support nested fields, repeated fields, or specifying a BigQuery mode for
fields (the mode will always be set to `NULLABLE`).
{{< /paragraph >}}

#### Using a TableSchema

To create and use a table schema as a `TableSchema` object, follow these steps.

<!-- Java specific - TableSchema -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
1. Create a list of `TableFieldSchema` objects. Each `TableFieldSchema` object
   represents a field in the table.

2. Create a `TableSchema` object and use the `setFields` method to specify your
   list of fields.

3. Use the `withSchema` method to provide your table schema when you apply a
   write transform.
{{< /paragraph >}}

<!-- Python specific - TableSchema -->

{{< paragraph class="language-py" wrap="span" >}}
1. Create a `TableSchema` object.

2. Create and append a `TableFieldSchema` object for each field in your table.

3. Next, use the `schema` parameter to provide your table schema when you apply
   a write transform. Set the parameterâ€™s value to the `TableSchema` object.
{{< /paragraph >}}

<!-- Common -->

The following example code shows how to create a `TableSchema` for a table with
two fields (source and quote) of type string.

{{< highlight java >}}
{{< code_sample "examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/snippets/transforms/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQuerySchemaCreate.java" bigquery_schema_create >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_schema_object >}}
{{< /highlight >}}


#### Using a string

<!-- Java specific - string -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
To create and use a table schema as a string that contains JSON-serialized
`TableSchema` object, follow these steps.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
1. Create a string that contains a JSON-serialized `TableSchema` object.

2. Use the `withJsonSchema` method to provide your table schema when you apply a
   write transform.
{{< /paragraph >}}

<!-- Python specific - string -->

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
To create and use a table schema as a string, follow these steps.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" wrap="span" >}}
1. Create a single comma separated string of the form
   "field1:type1,field2:type2,field3:type3" that defines a list of fields. The
   type should specify the fieldâ€™s BigQuery type.

2. Use the `schema` parameter to provide your table schema when you apply a
   write transform. Set the parameterâ€™s value to the string.
{{< /paragraph >}}

<!-- Common -->

The following example shows how to use a string to specify the same table schema
as the previous example.

{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
{{< code_sample "sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets.py" model_bigqueryio_schema >}}
{{< /highlight >}}


### Setting the insertion method

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
> The Beam SDK for Python does not currently support specifying the insertion
method.
{{< /paragraph >}}

BigQueryIO supports two methods of inserting data into BigQuery: load jobs and
streaming inserts. Each insertion method provides different tradeoffs of cost,
quota, and data consistency. See the BigQuery documentation for
[load jobs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/loading-data) and
[streaming inserts](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery)
for more information about these tradeoffs.

BigQueryIO chooses a default insertion method based on the input `PCollection`.

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
BigQueryIO uses load jobs when you apply a BigQueryIO write transform to a
bounded `PCollection`.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
BigQueryIO uses load jobs in the following situations:
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
* When you apply a BigQueryIO write transform to a bounded `PCollection`.
* When you apply a BigQueryIO write transform to an unbounded `PCollection` and
  use `BigQueryIO.write().withTriggeringFrequency()` to set the triggering
  frequency.
* When you specify load jobs as the insertion method using
  `BigQueryIO.write().withMethod(FILE_LOADS)`.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
BigQueryIO uses streaming inserts when you apply a BigQueryIO write transform to
an unbounded `PCollection`.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
BigQueryIO uses streaming inserts in the following situations:
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
* When you apply a BigQueryIO write transform to an unbounded `PCollection` and
  do not set the triggering frequency.
* When you specify streaming inserts as the insertion method using
  `BigQueryIO.write().withMethod(STREAMING_INSERTS)`.
{{< /paragraph >}}

<!-- Java specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
You can use `withMethod` to specify the desired insertion method. See
[Write.Method](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/{{< param release_latest >}}/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIO.Write.Method.html)
for the list of the available methods and their restrictions.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
***Note:*** If you use batch loads in a streaming pipeline, you must use
`withTriggeringFrequency` to specify a triggering frequency and `withNumFileShards` to specify number of file shards written.
{{< /paragraph >}}

### Writing to a table

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
To write to a BigQuery table, apply either a `writeTableRows` or `write`
transform.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
To write to a BigQuery table, apply the `WriteToBigQuery` transform.
`WriteToBigQuery` supports both batch mode and streaming mode. You must apply
the transform to a `PCollection` of dictionaries. In general, you'll need to use
another transform, such as `ParDo`, to format your output data into a
collection.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
The following examples use this `PCollection` that contains quotes.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
The `writeTableRows` method writes a `PCollection` of BigQuery `TableRow`
objects to a BigQuery table. Each element in the `PCollection` represents a
single row in the table. This example uses `writeTableRows` to write elements to a
`PCollection<TableRow>`.  The write operation creates a table if needed; if the
table already exists, it will be replaced.

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
The following example code shows how to apply a `WriteToBigQuery` transform to
write a `PCollection` of dictionaries to a BigQuery table. The write operation
creates a table if needed; if the table already exists, it will be replaced.

<!-- write (java-only) -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
The `write` transform writes a `PCollection` of custom typed objects to a BigQuery
table. Use `.withFormatFunction(SerializableFunction)` to provide a formatting
function that converts each input element in the `PCollection` into a
`TableRow`.  This example uses `write` to write a `PCollection<String>`. The
write operation creates a table if needed; if the table already exists, it will
be replaced.

When you use streaming inserts, you can decide what to do with failed records.
You can either keep retrying, or return the failed records in a separate
`PCollection` using the `WriteResult.getFailedInserts()` method.

### Using dynamic destinations

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
> The Beam SDK for Python does not currently support dynamic destinations.
{{< /paragraph >}}

You can use the dynamic destinations feature to write elements in a
`PCollection` to different BigQuery tables, possibly with different schemas.

The dynamic destinations feature groups your user type by a user-defined
destination key, uses the key to compute a destination table and/or schema, and
writes each group's elements to the computed destination.

In addition, you can also write your own types that have a mapping function to
`TableRow`, and you can use side inputs in all `DynamicDestinations` methods.

<!-- Java specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
To use dynamic destinations, you must create a `DynamicDestinations` object and
implement the following methods:
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
* `getDestination`: Returns an object that `getTable` and `getSchema` can use as
  the destination key to compute the destination table and/or schema.

* `getTable`: Returns the table (as a `TableDestination` object) for the
  destination key. This method must return a unique table for each unique
  destination.

* `getSchema`: Returns the table schema (as a `TableSchema` object) for the
  destination key.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
Then, use `write().to` with your `DynamicDestinations` object. This example
uses a `PCollection` that contains weather data and writes the data into a
different table for each year.

{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight py >}}
# The Beam SDK for Python does not currently support dynamic destinations.
{{< /highlight >}}

### Using time partitioning

{{< paragraph class="language-py" >}}
> The Beam SDK for Python does not currently support time partitioning.
{{< /paragraph >}}

BigQuery time partitioning divides your table into smaller partitions, which is
called a [partitioned table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables).
Partitioned tables make it easier for you to manage and query your data.

<!-- Java specific -->

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
To use BigQuery time partitioning, use one of these two methods:
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" wrap="span" >}}
* `withTimePartitioning`: This method takes a `TimePartitioning` class, and is
  only usable if you are writing to a single table.

* `withJsonTimePartitioning`: This method is the same as
  `withTimePartitioning`, but takes a JSON-serialized String object.
{{< /paragraph >}}

{{< paragraph class="language-java" >}}
This example generates one partition per day.
{{< /paragraph >}}

## Limitations

BigQueryIO currently has the following limitations.

1. You canâ€™t sequence the completion of a BigQuery write with other steps of
   your pipeline.

2. If you are using the Beam SDK for Python, you might have import size quota
   issues if you write a very large dataset. As a workaround, you can partition
   the dataset (for example, using Beam's `Partition` transform) and write to
   multiple BigQuery tables. The Beam SDK for Java does not have this limitation
   as it partitions your dataset for you.


## Additional examples

You can find additional examples that use BigQuery in Beam's examples
directories.

### Java cookbook examples

These examples are from the Java [cookbook examples](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/cookbook)
directory.

* [BigQueryTornadoes](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/cookbook/BigQueryTornadoes.java)
  reads the public samples of weather data from BigQuery, counts the number of
  tornadoes that occur in each month, and writes the results to a BigQuery
  table.

* [CombinePerKeyExamples](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/cookbook/CombinePerKeyExamples.java)
  reads the public Shakespeare data from BigQuery, and for each word in the
  dataset that exceeds a given length, generates a string containing the list of
  play names in which that word appears. The pipeline then writes the results to
  a BigQuery table.

* [FilterExamples](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/cookbook/FilterExamples.java)
  reads public samples of weather data from BigQuery, performs a projection
  on the data, finds the global mean of the temperature readings, filters on
  readings for a single given month, and outputs only data (for that month)
  that has a mean temp smaller than the derived global mean.

* [JoinExamples](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/cookbook/JoinExamples.java)
