# Managed I/O Connectors

Beam’s new Managed API streamlines how you use existing I/Os, offering both
simplicity and powerful enhancements. I/Os are now configured through a
lightweight, consistent interface: a simple configuration map with a unified
API that spans multiple connectors.

With Managed I/O, runners gain deeper insight into each I/O’s structure and
intent. This allows the runner to optimize performance, adjust behavior
dynamically, or even replace the I/O with a more efficient or updated
implementation behind the scenes.

For example, the DataflowRunner can seamlessly upgrade a Managed transform to
its latest SDK version, automatically applying bug fixes and new features (no
manual updates or user intervention required!)

## Supported SDKs

The Managed API is directly accessible through the
[Java](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/managed/Managed.html)
and
[Python](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.transforms.managed.html)
SDKs.

Additionally, some SDKs use the Managed API internally. For example, the Iceberg connector
used in [Beam YAML](https://beam.apache.org/releases/yamldoc/current/#writetoiceberg)
and Beam SQL is invoked via the Managed API under the hood.
