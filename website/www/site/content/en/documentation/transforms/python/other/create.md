Creates a collection containing a specified set of elements. This is
useful for testing, as well as creating an initial input to process
in parallel. For example, a single element to execute a one-time
`ParDo` or a list of filenames to be read.

## Examples
See [BEAM-7391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7391) for updates.
