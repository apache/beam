# Apache Beam&#8482; Downloads

> Beam SDK {{< param release_latest >}} is the latest released version.

## Using a central repository

The easiest way to use Apache Beam is via one of the released versions in a
central repository. The Java SDK is available on [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache.beam%22),
and the Python SDK is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apache-beam).

For example, if you are developing using Maven and want to use the SDK for Java
with the `DirectRunner`, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
      <artifactId>beam-sdks-java-core</artifactId>
      <version>{{< param release_latest >}}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
      <artifactId>beam-runners-direct-java</artifactId>
      <version>{{< param release_latest >}}</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>

Similarly in Python, if you are using PyPI and want to use the SDK for Python
with `DirectRunner`, add the following requirement to your `setup.py` file:

    apache-beam=={{< param release_latest >}}

Additionally, you may want to depend on additional SDK modules, such as IO
connectors or other extensions, and additional runners to execute your pipeline
at scale.

## Downloading source code

You can download the source code package for a release from the links in the
[Releases](#releases) section.

### Release integrity

You *must* [verify](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html) the integrity
of downloaded files. We provide OpenPGP signatures for every release file. This
signature should be matched against the
[KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/beam/KEYS) file which contains the OpenPGP
keys of Apache Beam's Release Managers. We also provide SHA-512 checksums for
every release file (or SHA-1 and MD5 checksums for older releases). After you
download the file, you should calculate a checksum for your download, and make
sure it is the same as ours.


## API stability

Apache Beam uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Version numbers use
the form `major.minor.incremental` and are incremented as follows:

* major version for incompatible API changes
* minor version for new functionality added in a backward-compatible manner
* incremental version for forward-compatible bug fixes

Please note that APIs marked [`@Experimental`](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/{{< param release_latest >}}/org/apache/beam/sdk/annotations/Experimental.html)
may change at any point and are not guaranteed to remain compatible across versions.

Additionally, any API may change before the first stable release, i.e., between
versions denoted `0.x.y`.

[Blog post](/blog/beam-2.7.0).

2.7.0 was [designated](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/896cbc9fef2e60f19b466d6b1e12ce1aeda49ce5065a0b1156233f01@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E) by the Beam community as a long term support (LTS) version. LTS versions are supported for a window of 6 months starting from the day it is marked as an LTS. Beam community will decide on which issues will be backported and when patch releases on the branch will be made on a case by case basis.

*LTS Update (2020-04-06):* Due to the lack of interest from users the Beam community decided not to maintain or publish new LTS releases. We encourage users to update early and often to the most recent releases.
