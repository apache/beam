# Tour of Beam

Here you can find a collection of the interactive notebooks available for Apache Beam, which are hosted in
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
The notebooks allow you to interactively play with the code and see how your changes affect the pipeline.
You don't need to install anything or modify your computer in any way to use these notebooks.

You can also [try an Apache Beam pipeline](/get-started/try-apache-beam) using the Java, Python, and Go SDKs.

## Get started

  <col style="width: auto;">
  <col style="width: 200px;">
  {{< row-colab
    title="Learn the basics"
    body="In this notebook we go through the basics of what is Apache Beam and how to get started."

## Transforms

Check the [Python transform catalog](/documentation/transforms/python/overview/)
for a complete list of the available transforms.

### Element-wise transforms
