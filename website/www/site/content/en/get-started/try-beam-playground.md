# Try Beam Playground (Beta)

Beam Playground is an interactive environment to try out Beam transforms and examples
without having to install Apache Beam in your environment.

You can try the available Apache Beam examples at
[Beam Playground](https://play.beam.apache.org/).

## Beam Playground WordCount Example

{{< playground height="700px" >}}
{{< playground_snippet language="java" path="SDK_JAVA_MinimalWordCount" >}}

{{< playground_snippet language="go" path="SDK_GO_MinimalWordCount" >}}
{{< playground_snippet language="scio" path="SDK_SCIO_MinimalWordCount" >}}
{{< /playground >}}

See [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/playground/load_your_code.md) for adding new examples.
