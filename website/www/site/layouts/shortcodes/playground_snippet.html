{{/*

Creates an embedded Playground tab with a given example. Must be used within 'playground' shortcode
because here only a div is created and not an iframe. It is 'playground' that actually creates
an iframe.

Required parameters:
- example - the example ID or snippet ID.
- language - the string to be passed as SDK to playground. 'py' translates to 'python'.

Optional parameters:
- readonly - comma-separated section names to make read-only.
- show - section name, hides everything except it, makes the entire code read-only.
- unfold - comma-separated section names, folds all blocks not overlapping with them.
