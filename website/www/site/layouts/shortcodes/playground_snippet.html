{{/*

Creates an embedded Playground tab with a given example. Must be used within 'playground' shortcode
because here only a div is created and not an iframe. It is 'playground' that actually creates
an iframe.

Required parameters:
- language - the string to be passed as SDK to playground. 'py' translates to 'python'.
- any of the following:
    - path - the example in the catalog.
    - shared - the snippet ID shared by a user.
    - url - the URL of the example code.

Optional parameters:
- readonly - comma-separated section names to make read-only.
- show - section name, hides everything except it, makes the entire code read-only.
- unfold - comma-separated section names, folds all blocks not overlapping with them.
