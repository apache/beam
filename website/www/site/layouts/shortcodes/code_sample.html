  This shortcode is used to fetch a piece of code with tags from Beam code.
  In setupDockerContainer stage of build process, we run build_code_samples.sh script, which
  copies Beam project files from which we take code snippets to website/www/site/code_samples
  directory. We do that because Hugo can't access files which are outside of its project tree
  (Hugo's root is the directory that contains config.toml). When copying, we name this files
  according to convention path_to_file_filename.extension in order to avoid name conflicts.
  .Get 0 references an argument passed to code_sample shortcode which is a path to file with
  code snippet. So if we pass path/to/file/filename.py to code_sample, $path variable will
  have value code_samples/path_to_file_filename.py which Hugo can access.
  There should be no breaklines here to make sure the string results do not get impacts of newlines.
