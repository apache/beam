These are the main sources of the website for Apache Beam, hosted at
https://beam.apache.org/.

## About this site

The Beam website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Additionally,
for additional formatting capabilities, this website uses
[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Documentation generated from source code, such as Javadoc and Pydoc, is stored
separately on the [beam-site
repository](https://github.com/apache/beam-site/tree/release-docs).

## Active development

Website development requires Docker installed if you wish to preview changes and
run website tests.

The following command is used to build and serve the website locally.

    $ ./gradlew :website:serveWebsite

Any changes made locally will trigger a rebuild of the website.

Websites tests may be run using this command:

    $ ./gradlew :website:testWebsite

## Website push

After a PR is merged, a background Jenkins job will automatically generate and
push [website
content](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/asf-site/website/generated-content)
to the asf-site branch. This content is later picked up and pushed to
https://beam.apache.org/.

## Additional Information

### Writing blog posts

Blog posts are created in the `_posts` directory.

If this is your first post, make sure to add yourself to `_data\authors.yml`.

While you a working on your post before the publishing time listed in its header,
add `--future` when running Jekyll in order to view your draft on your local copy of
the site.

### Adding Jekyll plugins

If you modify the site to use additional Jekyll plugins, add them in `Gemfile`
and then run `bundle update`, which will regenerate the complete `Gemfile.lock`.
Make sure that the updated `Gemfile.lock` is included in your pull request. For more information,
see the Bundler [documentation](https://bundler.io/v1.3/rationale.html).
