# SELECT

The main functionality of Beam SQL is the `SELECT` statement. This is how you
query and join data. The operations supported are a subset of
[Apache Calcite SQL](http://calcite.apache.org/docs/reference.html#grammar).

Generally, the semantics of queries is standard. Please see the following
sections to learn about extensions for supporting Beam's unified
batch/streaming model:

 - [Joins]({{ site.baseurl}}/documentation/dsls/sql/joins)
 - [Windowing & Triggering]({{ site.baseurl}}/documentation/dsls/sql/windowing-and-triggering/)

Below is a curated grammar of the supported syntax in Beam SQL

```
query:
	{
          select
      |   query UNION [ ALL ] query
      |   query MINUS [ ALL ] query
      |   query INTERSECT [ ALL ] query
	}
    [ ORDER BY orderItem [, orderItem ]* LIMIT count [OFFSET offset] ]

orderItem:
      expression [ ASC | DESC ]

select:
      SELECT
          { * | projectItem [, projectItem ]* }
      FROM tableExpression
      [ WHERE booleanExpression ]
      [ GROUP BY { groupItem [, groupItem ]* } ]
      [ HAVING booleanExpression ]

projectItem:
      expression [ [ AS ] columnAlias ]
  |   tableAlias . *

tableExpression:
      tableReference [, tableReference ]*
  |   tableExpression [ ( LEFT | RIGHT ) [ OUTER ] ] JOIN tableExpression [ joinCondition ]

booleanExpression:
    expression [ IS NULL | IS NOT NULL ]
  | expression [ > | >= | = | < | <= | <> ] expression
  | booleanExpression [ AND | OR ] booleanExpression
  | NOT booleanExpression
  | '(' booleanExpression ')'

joinCondition:
      ON booleanExpression

tableReference:
      tableName [ [ AS ] alias ]

values:
      VALUES expression [, expression ]*

groupItem:
      expression
  |   '(' expression [, expression ]* ')'
  |   HOP '(' expression [, expression ]* ')'
  |   TUMBLE '(' expression [, expression ]* ')'
  |   SESSION '(' expression [, expression ]* ')'

```
