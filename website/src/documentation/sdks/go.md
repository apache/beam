# Apache Beam Go SDK

The Go SDK for Apache Beam provides a simple, powerful API for building both batch and streaming parallel data processing pipelines. It is based on the following
[design](https://s.apache.org/beam-go-sdk-design-rfc).

## Get Started with the Go SDK

Get started with the [Beam Go SDK quickstart]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/quickstart-go) to set up your development environment and run an example pipeline. Then, read through the [Beam programming guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/programming-guide) to learn the basic concepts that apply to all SDKs in Beam.

See the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam) for more detailed information.

## Status

The Go SDK is currently experimental, does not yet offer any compatibility guarantees and is not recommended for production usage. It supports most features, but not all.
