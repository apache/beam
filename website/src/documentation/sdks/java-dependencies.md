# Beam SDK for Java dependencies

The Beam SDKs depend on common third-party components which then
import additional dependencies. Version collisions can result in unexpected
behavior in the service. If you are using any of these packages in your code, be
aware that some libraries are not forward-compatible and you may need to pin to
the listed versions that will be in scope during execution.

Compile and runtime dependencies for your Beam SDK version are listed in `BeamModulePlugin.groovy` in the Beam repository. To view them, perform the following steps:

1. Open `BeamModulePlugin.groovy`.

    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/v<VERSION_NUMBER>/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/org/apache/beam/gradle/BeamModulePlugin.groovy
    ```

    Replace `<VERSION_NUMBER>` with the major.minor.patch version of the SDK. For example, <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/v{{ site.release_latest }}/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/org/apache/beam/gradle/BeamModulePlugin.groovy>{:target="_blank"} will provide the dependencies for the {{ site.release_latest }} release.
    
2. Review the list under `project.ext.library`. 

    **Note:** Some dependencies in the list use version variables, such as `google_auth_version`. These variables are defined prior to the `project.ext.library` map definition.

You can also retrieve this list by creating a new project through Maven and resolving the dependencies.

1. Define the Beam SDK and Java versions for the new project. 

    ```
    export BEAM_VERSION={{ site.release_latest }}
    export JAVA_VERSION=11
    ```

2. Create the project.

    ```
    mvn archetype:generate \
        -DinteractiveMode=false \
        -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.beam \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=beam-sdks-java-maven-archetypes-starter \
        -DarchetypeVersion=$BEAM_VERSION \
        -DtargetPlatform=$JAVA_VERSION \
        -DartifactId=check-pipeline-dependencies \
        -DgroupId=org.apache.beam.samples
    ```

3. Change to the new project directory.

    ```
    cd check-pipeline-dependencies
    ```

4. Resolve and list the dependencies.

    ```
    mvn dependency:resolve && mvn -o dependency:list
    ```
