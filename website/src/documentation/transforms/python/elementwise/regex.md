{% include button-pydoc.md path="apache_beam.transforms.util" class="Regex" %}

Filters input string elements based on a regex. May also transform them based on the matching groups.

## Examples

In the following examples, we create a pipeline with a `PCollection` of text strings.
Then, we use the `Regex` transform to search, replace, and split through the text elements using
[regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).

You can use tools to help you create and test your regular expressions, such as
[regex101](https://regex101.com/).
Make sure to specify the Python flavor at the left side bar.

Lets look at the
[regular expression `(?P<icon>[^\s,]+), *(\w+), *(\w+)`](https://regex101.com/r/Z7hTTj/3)
for example.
It matches anything that is not a whitespace `\s` (`[ \t\n\r\f\v]`) or comma `,`
until a comma is found and stores that in the named group `icon`,
this can match even `utf-8` strings.
Then it matches any number of whitespaces, followed by at least one word character
`\w` (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]`), which is stored in the second group for the *name*.
It does the same with the third group for the *duration*.

> *Note:* To avoid unexpected string escaping in your regular expressions,
> it is recommended to use
> [raw strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html?highlight=raw#string-and-bytes-literals)
> such as `r'raw-string'` instead of `'escaped-string'`.

### Example 1: Regex match

`Regex.matches` keeps only the elements that match the regular expression,
returning the matched group.
The argument `group` is set to `0` (the entire match) by default,
but can be set to a group number like `3`, or to a named group like `'icon'`.

`Regex.matches` starts to match the regular expression at the beginning of the string.
To match until the end of the string, add `'$'` at the end of the regular expression.

To start matching at any point instead of the beginning of the string, use
[`Regex.find(regex)`](#example-4-regex-find).

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_matches %}```

{:.notebook-skip}
Output `PCollection` after `Regex.matches`:

```
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex_test.py tag:plants_matches %}```

{% include buttons-code-snippet.md
  py="sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py"
  notebook="examples/notebooks/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/regex"
%}

### Example 2: Regex match with all groups

`Regex.all_matches` keeps only the elements that match the regular expression,
returning *all groups* as a list.
The groups are returned in the order encountered in the regular expression,
including `group 0` (the entire match) as the first group.

`Regex.all_matches` starts to match the regular expression at the beginning of the string.
To match until the end of the string, add `'$'` at the end of the regular expression.

To start matching at any point instead of the beginning of the string, use
[`Regex.find_all(regex, group=Regex.ALL, outputEmpty=False)`](#example-5-regex-find-all).

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_all_matches %}```

{:.notebook-skip}
Output `PCollection` after `Regex.all_matches`:

{:.notebook-skip}
```
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex_test.py tag:plants_all_matches %}```

{% include buttons-code-snippet.md
  py="sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py"
  notebook="examples/notebooks/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/regex"
%}

### Example 3: Regex match into key-value pairs

`Regex.matches_kv` keeps only the elements that match the regular expression,
returning a key-value pair using the specified groups.
The argument `keyGroup` is set to a group number like `3`, or to a named group like `'icon'`.
The argument `valueGroup` is set to `0` (the entire match) by default,
but can be set to a group number like `3`, or to a named group like `'icon'`.

`Regex.matches_kv` starts to match the regular expression at the beginning of the string.
To match until the end of the string, add `'$'` at the end of the regular expression.

To start matching at any point instead of the beginning of the string, use
[`Regex.find_kv(regex, keyGroup)`](#example-6-regex-find-as-key-value-pairs).

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_matches_kv %}```

{:.notebook-skip}
Output `PCollection` after `Regex.matches_kv`:

{:.notebook-skip}
```
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex_test.py tag:plants_matches_kv %}```

{% include buttons-code-snippet.md
  py="sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py"
  notebook="examples/notebooks/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/regex"
%}

### Example 4: Regex find

`Regex.find` keeps only the elements that match the regular expression,
returning the matched group.
The argument `group` is set to `0` (the entire match) by default,
but can be set to a group number like `3`, or to a named group like `'icon'`.

`Regex.find` matches the first occurrence of the regular expression in the string.
To start matching at the beginning, add `'^'` at the beginning of the regular expression.
To match until the end of the string, add `'$'` at the end of the regular expression.

If you need to match from the start only, consider using
[`Regex.matches(regex)`](#example-1-regex-match).

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_find %}```

{:.notebook-skip}
Output `PCollection` after `Regex.find`:

{:.notebook-skip}
```
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex_test.py tag:plants_matches %}```

{% include buttons-code-snippet.md
  py="sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py"
  notebook="examples/notebooks/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/regex"
%}

### Example 5: Regex find all

`Regex.find_all` returns a list of all the matches of the regular expression,
returning the matched group.
The argument `group` is set to `0` by default, but can be set to a group number like `3`, to a named group like `'icon'`, or to `Regex.ALL` to return all groups.
The argument `outputEmpty` is set to `True` by default, but can be set to `False` to skip elements where no matches were found.

`Regex.find_all` matches the regular expression anywhere it is found in the string.
To start matching at the beginning, add `'^'` at the start of the regular expression.
To match until the end of the string, add `'$'` at the end of the regular expression.

If you need to match all groups from the start only, consider using
[`Regex.all_matches(regex)`](#example-2-regex-match-with-all-groups).

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_find_all %}```

{:.notebook-skip}
Output `PCollection` after `Regex.find_all`:

  notebook="examples/notebooks/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/regex"
%}

### Example 6: Regex find as key-value pairs

`Regex.find_kv` returns a list of all the matches of the regular expression,
returning a key-value pair using the specified groups.
The argument `keyGroup` is set to a group number like `3`, or to a named group like `'icon'`.
The argument `valueGroup` is set to `0` (the entire match) by default,
but can be set to a group number like `3`, or to a named group like `'icon'`.

`Regex.find_kv` matches the first occurrence of the regular expression in the string.
To start matching at the beginning, add `'^'` at the beginning of the regular expression.
To match until the end of the string, add `'$'` at the end of the regular expression.

If you need to match as key-value pairs from the start only, consider using
[`Regex.matches_kv(regex)`](#example-3-regex-match-into-key-value-pairs).

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_find_kv %}```

{:.notebook-skip}
Output `PCollection` after `Regex.find_kv`:

{% include buttons-code-snippet.md
  py="sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py"
  notebook="examples/notebooks/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/regex"
%}

### Example 7: Regex replace all

`Regex.replace_all` returns the string with all the occurrences of the regular expression replaced by another string.
You can also use
[backreferences](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=backreference#re.sub)
on the `replacement`.

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_replace_all %}```

{:.notebook-skip}
Output `PCollection` after `Regex.replace_all`:

```
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex_test.py tag:plants_replace_all %}```

{% include buttons-code-snippet.md
  py="sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py"
  notebook="examples/notebooks/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/regex"
%}

### Example 8: Regex replace first

`Regex.replace_first` returns the string with the first occurrence of the regular expression replaced by another string.
You can also use
[backreferences](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=backreference#re.sub)
on the `replacement`.

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_replace_first %}```

{% include buttons-code-snippet.md
  py="sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py"
  notebook="examples/notebooks/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/regex"
%}

### Example 9: Regex split

`Regex.split` returns the list of strings that were delimited by the specified regular expression.
The argument `outputEmpty` is set to `False` by default, but can be set to `True` to keep empty items in the output list.

```py
{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/elementwise/regex.py tag:regex_split %}```

{:.notebook-skip}
Output `PCollection` after `Regex.split`:

* [FlatMap]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/flatmap) behaves the same as `Map`, but for
  each input it may produce zero or more outputs.
* [Map]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/map) applies a simple 1-to-1 mapping function over each element in the collection
