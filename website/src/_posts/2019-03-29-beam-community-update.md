The start of 2019 has been a busy time for the Beam community and the Apache community as a whole. <!--more--> Our way of community building was featured on the [Apache blog](https://blogs.apache.org/comdev/date/20190222), InfoWorld awarded Apache Beam with the [technology of the year award](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3336072/infoworlds-2019-technology-of-the-year-award-winners.html), [more Beam meetups](https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Apache-Beam/events/257482350) have been happening around the world, and this while we have been building up to the [20th anniversary of the Apache Software Foundation](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/03/celebrating-20-years-of-apache.html), including contributions from the Beam community:

Other meetups coming up in Europe will be located in [Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/Apache-Beam-Stockholm) and [Paris](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Apache-Beam-Meetup) - keep an eye out on the meetup pages. More to the west, we have the [Bay Area meetup](https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Apache-Beam), and the community is looking into kicking off a meetup in Toronto!
