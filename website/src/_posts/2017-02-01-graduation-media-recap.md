One year ago today Apache Beam was accepted into incubation at the Apache
Software Foundation. The community's work over the past year culminated, just
over three weeks ago, with an [announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2017/01/10/beam-graduates.html)
that Apache Beam has successfully graduated as a new Top-Level Project at the
foundation. Graduation sparked an additional interest in the project, from
corporate endorsements, news articles, interviews, to the volume of traffic to
our website and mailing lists.

Corporate endorsements include Google, PayPal, Talend, data Artisans, and
others. You can read more in the following blog posts:

Graduation and media coverage helped push Beam website traffic to record levels.
The website traffic, measured in unique sessions per hour, peaked at more than
15 times above the previous week’s numbers. In a steady state, the traffic is
several times larger than before graduation.

Hopefully these perspectives entice you to join us on this exciting ride, either
as a user or a contributor, as we work towards our first release with API
stability. If you’d like to try out Apache Beam today, check out the latest
[0.4.0 release]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/downloads/). We welcome
contribution and participation from anyone through our mailing lists, issue
tracker, pull requests, and events.
