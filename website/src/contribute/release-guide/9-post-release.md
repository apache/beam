# Improve the process

It is important that we improve the release processes over time. Once youâ€™ve finished the release,
please take a step back and look what areas of this process and be improved. 
Perhaps some part of the process can be simplified. Perhaps parts of this guide can be clarified.

If we have specific ideas, please start a discussion on the `dev@` mailing list and/or propose a pull request to update this guide. Thanks!
