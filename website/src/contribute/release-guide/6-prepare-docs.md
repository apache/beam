# Prepare the documentation

*****


## Update and Verify Javadoc

The build with `-PisRelease` creates the combined Javadoc for the release in `sdks/java/javadoc`.

The file `sdks/java/javadoc/build.gradle` contains a list of modules to include
in and exclude, plus a list of offline URLs that populate links from Beam's
Javadoc to the Javadoc for other modules that Beam depends on.

* Confirm that new modules added since the last release have been added to the
  inclusion list as appropriate.

* Confirm that the excluded package list is up to date.

* Verify the version numbers for offline links match the versions used by Beam. If
  the version number has changed, download a new version of the corresponding
  `<module>-docs/package-list` file.


*****


## Build the Pydoc API reference

Make sure you have ```tox``` installed: 

```
pip install tox
```

Create the Python SDK documentation using sphinx by running a helper script.

```
cd sdks/python && tox -e docs
```

By default the Pydoc is generated in `sdks/python/target/docs/_build`. 

Set `${PYDOC_ROOT}` be the absolute path to `_build`.

## Propose pull requests for website updates

Beam publishes API reference manuals for each release on the website. For Java
and Python SDKs, thatâ€™s Javadoc and PyDoc, respectively. The final step of
building the candidate is to propose website pull requests that update these
manuals.

Merge the pull requests only after finalizing the release. To avoid invalid
redirects for the 'current' version, merge these PRs in the order listed. Once
the PR is merged, the new contents will get picked up automatically and served
to the Beam website, usually within an hour.


### Javadoc PR against `apache/beam-site`

This pull request is against the `apache/beam-site` repo, on the `release-docs`
branch.

* Add the new Javadoc to [SDK API Reference page](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/) page, as follows:
  * Unpack the Maven artifact `org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-javadoc` into some temporary location. Call this `${JAVADOC_TMP}`.
  * Copy the generated Javadoc into the website repository: `cp -r ${JAVADOC_TMP} javadoc/${RELEASE}`.
* Add the new Pydoc to [SDK API Reference page](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/) page, as follows:
  * Copy the generated Pydoc into the website repository: `cp -r ${PYDOC_ROOT} pydoc/${RELEASE}`.
  * Remove `.doctrees` directory.
* Stage files using: `git add --all javadoc/ pydoc/`.



### Website update for new release version

This pull request is against the `apache/beam` repo, on the `master` branch.

* Update the `release_latest` version flag in `/website/_config.yml`, and list
  the new release in `/website/src/get-started/downloads.md`, linking to the
  source code download and the Release Notes in JIRA.
* Update the `RedirectMatch` rule in
  [/website/src/.htaccess](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/website/src/.htaccess)
  to point to the new release. See file history for examples.



### Blog post

Write a blog post similar to https://beam.apache.org/blog/2019/07/31/beam-2.14.0.html

__Tip__: Use git log to find contributors to the releases. (e.g: `git log --pretty='%aN' ^v2.10.0 v2.11.0 | sort | uniq`).
Make sure to clean it up, as there may be duplicate or incorrect user names.

__NOTE__: Make sure to include any breaking changes, even to `@Experimental` features,
all major features and bug fixes, and all known issues.

   [release]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/downloads/), 
   publish the [Java API reference manual](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/), 
   and publish the [Python API reference manual](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/);

You can (optionally) also do additional verification by:
1. Check that Python zip file contains the `README.md`, `NOTICE`, and `LICENSE` files;
1. Check hashes (e.g. `md5sum -c *.md5` and `sha1sum -c *.sha1`);

1. `grep` for legal headers in each file;
1. Run all jenkins suites and include links to passing tests in the voting email. (Select "Run with parameters");
