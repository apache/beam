Roadmap for connectors developed using Go SDK.

* We hope to add a Splittable DoFn implementation to Go SDK to support developing new sources. In the
meantime bounded sources can be developed in the form of ParDos. See
[Authoring I/O Transforms](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/authoring-overview/) for more details.

* Go SDK plans to utilize currently available Java and Python connectors
through cross-language transforms feature.
