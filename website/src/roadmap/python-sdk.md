# Python SDK Roadmap

## Python 3 Support

Apache Beam 2.11.0 is the first release that offers partial support for Python 3. As of 2.11.0, only Python 3.5 on Direct and Dataflow runners has been sufficiently tested, and Python 3 support remains an active work in progress. Current goal is to extend Beam codebase compatibility with Python 3.6, 3.7, address [known issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1251?focusedCommentId=16789854&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16789854) and increase test coverage.
