# Euphoria API

Easy to use Java 8 DSL for the Beam Java SDK. Provides a high-level abstraction of Beam transformations, which is both easy to read and write. Can be used as a complement to existing Beam pipelines (convertible back and forth). You can have a glimpse of the API at [WordCount example]({{ site.baseurl
}}/documentation/sdks/java/euphoria/#wordcount-example).

This roadmap is in progress. In the meantime, here are some resources:
