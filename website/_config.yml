description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Apache Beam is an open source, unified model and set of language-specific
  SDKs for defining and executing data processing workflows, and also data
  ingestion and integration flows, supporting Enterprise Integration Patterns
  (EIPs) and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). Dataflow pipelines simplify the
  mechanics of large-scale batch and streaming data processing and can run on a
  number of runtimes like Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow
  (a cloud service). Beam also brings DSL in different languages, allowing
  users to easily implement their data integration processes.
