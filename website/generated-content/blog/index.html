Dataflow pipelines simplify the mechanics of large-scale batch and streaming data processing and can run on a number of runtimes like Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow (a cloud service). Beam also brings DSL in different languages, allowing users to easily implement their data integration processes."><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700" rel=stylesheet><link rel=preload href=/scss/main.min.408fddfe3e8a45f87a5a8c9a839d77db667c1c534e5e5cd0d957ffc3dd6c14cf.css as=style><link href=/scss/main.min.408fddfe3e8a45f87a5a8c9a839d77db667c1c534e5e5cd0d957ffc3dd6c14cf.css rel=stylesheet integrity><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js></script><style>.body__contained img{max-width:100%}</style><script type=text/javascript src=/js/bootstrap.min.2979f9a6e32fc42c3e7406339ee9fe76b31d1b52059776a02b4a7fa6a4fd280a.js defer></script>

With the operator, we can simplify the deployment and management of Apache Beam pipelines.
In this post, we develop an Apache Beam pipeline using the Python SDK and deploy it on an Apache Flink cluster by using the Apache Flink runner. We first deploy an Apache Kafka cluster on a minikube cluster, because the pipeline uses Kafka topics for its data source and sink. Then, we develop the pipeline as a Python package and add the package to a custom Docker image so that Python user code can be executed externally. For deployment, we create a Flink session cluster using the Flink Kubernetes Operator, and deploy the pipeline using a Kubernetes job. Finally, we check the output of the application by sending messages to the input Kafka topic using a Python producer application.

Learning the Beam model, downloading dependencies for the SDK language of choice, debugging the pipeline, and maintaining the pipeline code is a lot of overhead for users who want to write a simple to intermediate data processing pipeline. There have been strides in making the SDK&amp;rsquo;s entry points easier, but for many, it is still a long way from being a painless process.
To address some of these issues and simplify the entry point to Beam, we have introduced a new way to specify Beam pipelines by using configuration files rather than code. This new SDK, known as Beam YAML, employs a declarative approach to creating data processing pipelines using YAML, a widely used data serialization language.</div></a><a class="post-card tf-filter-item" href=/blog/beam-2.55.0/ data-categories='blog release '><div class="post-info post-category"><p>blog & release

Beam also has a fancy new SQL command line that you can use to query your data interactively, be it Batch or Streaming. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it, check out https://bit.ly/ExploreBeamSQL.
A nice feature of the SQL CLI is that you can use CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE commands to add data sources to be accessed in the CLI. Currently, the CLI supports creating tables from BigQuery, PubSub, Kafka, and text files.

The ASF blog featured our way of community building and we&amp;rsquo;ve had more Beam meetups around the world. Apache Beam also received the Technology of the Year Award from InfoWorld.
As these events happened, we were building up to the 20th anniversary of the Apache Software Foundation. The contributions of the Beam community were a part of Maximilian Michels blog post on the success of the ASF&amp;rsquo;s open source development model:

&amp;mdash; Apache - The ASF (@TheASF) 26 maart 2019 In that spirit, let&amp;rsquo;s have an overview of the things that have happened, what the next few months look like, and how we can foster even more community growth.
Meetups We&amp;rsquo;ve had a flurry of activity, with several meetups in the planning process and more popping up globally over time. As diversity of contributors is a core ASF value, this geographic spread is exciting for the community. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture from the latest Apache Beam meetup organized at Lyft in San Francisco:
We have more Bay Area meetups coming soon, and the community is looking into kicking off a meetup in Toronto!
London had its first meetup of 2019 at the start of April:
and Stockholm had its second meetup at the start of May:

&amp;mdash; Matthias Baetens 🌆 (@matthiasbaetens) 6 May 2019 Keep an eye out for a meetup in Paris.
If you are interested in starting your own meetup, feel free to reach out! Good places to start include our Slack channel, the dev and user mailing lists, or the Apache Beam Twitter.
Even if you can’t travel to these meetups, you can stay informed on the happenings of the community. The talks and sessions from previous conferences and meetups are archived on the Apache Beam YouTube channel. If you want your session added to the channel, don’t hesitate to get in touch!
Summits The first summit of the year will be held in Berlin:
You can find more info on the website and read about the inaugural edition of the Beam Summit Europe here. At these summits, you have the opportunity to meet with other Apache Beam creators and users, get expert advice, learn from the speaker sessions, and participate in workshops.
We strongly encourage you to get involved again this year! You can participate in the following ways for the upcoming summit in Europe:
🎫 If you want to secure your ticket to attend the Beam Summit Europe 2019, check our event page.
💸 If you want to make the Summit even more awesome, check out our sponsor booklet!
We also launched the CfP for our Beam Summit in North America, which will be held in collaboration with ApacheCon.
🎤 If you want to give a talk, take a look at our CfP.
Stay tuned for more information on the summit in North America and Asia.
Why community engagement matters Why we need a strong Apache Beam community:
We&amp;rsquo;re receiving lots of code contributions and need committers to review those and help onboard new contributors to the project. We want people to feel a sense of ownership to the project. By fostering this level of engagement, the work becomes even more exciting. A healthy community has a further reach and leads to more growth. More hours can be contributed to the project as we can spread the work and ownership. Why are we organizing these summits:
We&amp;rsquo;d like to give folks a place to meet, congregate, and share ideas. We know that offline interactions often changes the nature of the online ones in a positive manner. Building an active and diverse community is part of the Apache Way. These summits provide an opportunity for us to engage people from different locations, companies, and backgrounds.</div></a><a class="post-card tf-filter-item" href=/blog/beam-2.12.0/ data-categories='blog release '><div class="post-info post-category"><p>blog & release

The beamsummit.org site provides all the information you need towards the upcoming Beam Summits in Europe, Asia and North America in 2019. You will find information about the conference theme, the speakers and sessions, the abstract submission timeline and the registration process, the conference venues and hosting cities - and much more that you will find useful until and during the Beam Summits 2019.
We are working to make the website easy to use, so that anyone who is organizing a Beam event can rely on it. You can find the code for it in Github.
The pages will be updated on a regular basis, but we also love hearing thoughts from our community! Let us know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions, and help us improve! Also, if you are thinking of organizing a Beam event, please feel free to reach out for support, and to use the code in GitHub as well.
We sincerely hope that you like the new Beam Summit website and will find it useful for accessing information. Enjoy browsing around!
See you in Berlin!

Jean-Baptiste Onofré</p><div class=post-summary>On January 10, 2017, Apache Beam got promoted as a Top-Level Apache Software Foundation project. It was an important milestone that validated the value of the project, legitimacy of its community, and heralded its growing adoption. In the past year, Apache Beam has been on a phenomenal growth trajectory, with significant growth in its community and feature set. Let us walk you through some of the notable achievements.</div></a><a class="post-card tf-filter-item" href=/blog/timely-processing/ data-categories='blog '><div class="post-info post-category"><p>blog</p><p>2017/08/28</p></div><p class=post-title>Timely (and Stateful) Processing with Apache Beam</p><p class=post-info>Kenneth Knowles</p><div class=post-summary>In a prior blog post, I introduced the basics of stateful processing in Apache Beam, focusing on the addition of state to per-element processing. So-called timely processing complements stateful processing in Beam by letting you set timers to request a (stateful) callback at some point in the future.
What can you do with timers in Beam? Here are some examples:
You can output data buffered in state after some amount of processing time. You can take special action when the watermark estimates that you have received all data up to a specified point in event time. You can author workflows with timeouts that alter state and emit output in response to the absence of additional input for some period of time. These are just a few possibilities. State and timers together form a powerful programming paradigm for fine-grained control to express a huge variety of workflows. Stateful and timely processing in Beam is portable across data processing engines and integrated with Beam&amp;rsquo;s unified model of event time windowing in both streaming and batch processing.</div></a><a class="post-card tf-filter-item" href=/blog/splittable-do-fn/ data-categories='blog '><div class="post-info post-category"><p>blog</p><p>2017/08/16</p></div><p class=post-title>Powerful and modular IO connectors with Splittable DoFn in Apache Beam</p><p class=post-info>Eugene Kirpichov</p><div class=post-summary>One of the most important parts of the Apache Beam ecosystem is its quickly growing set of connectors that allow Beam pipelines to read and write data to various data storage systems (&amp;ldquo;IOs&amp;rdquo;). Currently, Beam ships over 20 IO connectors with many more in active development. As user demands for IO connectors grew, our work on improving the related Beam APIs (in particular, the Source API) produced an unexpected result: a generalization of Beam&amp;rsquo;s most basic primitive, DoFn.</div></a><a class="post-card tf-filter-item" href=/blog/beam-first-stable-release/ data-categories='blog '><div class="post-info post-category"><p>blog</p><p>2017/05/17</p></div><p class=post-title>Apache Beam publishes the first stable release</p><p class=post-info>Davor Bonaci &
