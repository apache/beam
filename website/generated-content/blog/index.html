Beam also brings DSL in different languages, allowing users to easily implement their data integration processes.

<p>On January 10, 2017, Apache Beam got <a href="/blog/2017/01/10/beam-graduates.html">promoted</a>
as a Top-Level Apache Software Foundation project. It was an important milestone
that validated the value of the project, legitimacy of its community, and
heralded its growing adoption. In the past year, Apache Beam has been on a
phenomenal growth trajectory, with significant growth in its community and
feature set. Let us walk you through some of the notable achievements.</p>

<p>In a <a href="/blog/2017/02/13/stateful-processing.html">prior blog
post</a>, I
introduced the basics of stateful processing in Apache Beam, focusing on the
addition of state to per-element processing. So-called <em>timely</em> processing
complements stateful processing in Beam by letting you set timers to request a
(stateful) callback at some point in the future.</p>

<p>What can you do with timers in Beam? Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can output data buffered in state after some amount of processing time.</li>
  <li>You can take special action when the watermark estimates that you have
received all data up to a specified point in event time.</li>
  <li>You can author workflows with timeouts that alter state and emit output in
response to the absence of additional input for some period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few possibilities. State and timers together form a powerful
programming paradigm for fine-grained control to express a huge variety of
workflows.  Stateful and timely processing in Beam is portable across data
processing engines and integrated with Beam’s unified model of event time
windowing in both streaming and batch processing.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts of the Apache Beam ecosystem is its quickly
growing set of connectors that allow Beam pipelines to read and write data to
various data storage systems (“IOs”). Currently, Beam ships <a href="/documentation/io/built-in/">over 20 IO
connectors</a> with many more in
active development. As user demands for IO connectors grew, our work on
improving the related Beam APIs (in particular, the Source API) produced an
unexpected result: a generalization of Beam’s most basic primitive, <code class="highlighter-rouge">DoFn</code>.</p>

<p>Beam lets you process unbounded, out-of-order, global-scale data with portable
high-level pipelines. Stateful processing is a new feature of the Beam model
that expands the capabilities of Beam, unlocking new use cases and new
efficiencies. In this post, I will guide you through stateful processing in
Beam: how it works, how it fits in with the other features of the Beam model,
what you might use it for, and what it looks like in code.</p>

<p>One year ago today Apache Beam was accepted into incubation at the Apache
Software Foundation. The community’s work over the past year culminated, just
over three weeks ago, with an <a href="/blog/2017/01/10/beam-graduates.html">announcement</a>
that Apache Beam has successfully graduated as a new Top-Level Project at the
foundation. Graduation sparked an additional interest in the project, from
corporate endorsements, news articles, interviews, to the volume of traffic to
our website and mailing lists.</p>

<p>The latest release 0.4.0 of <a href="/">Apache Beam</a> adds a new runner for <a href="http://apex.apache.org/">Apache Apex</a>. We are excited to reach this initial milestone and are looking forward to continued collaboration between the Beam and Apex communities to advance the runner.</p>

<p>The Beam Programming Model unifies writing pipelines for Batch and Streaming
pipelines. We’ve recently introduced a new PTransform to write tests for
pipelines that will be run over unbounded datasets and must handle out-of-order
and delayed data.</p>

<p>Tyler Akidau and I gave a <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ny/public/schedule/detail/52129">three-hour tutorial</a> on Apache Beam at Strata+Hadoop World 2016. We had a plethora of help from our TAs: Kenn Knowles, Reuven Lax, Felipe Hoffa, Slava Chernyak, and Jamie Grier. There were a total of 66 people that attended the session.</p>

<p>It’s been just over six months since Apache Beam was formally accepted into incubation with the <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>. As a community, we’ve been hard at work getting Beam off the ground.</p>

<p>I’m happy to announce that Apache Beam has officially released its first
version – 0.1.0-incubating. This is an exciting milestone for the project,
which joined the Apache Software Foundation and the Apache Incubator earlier
this year.</p>

<p>We recently achieved a major milestone by adding support for windowing to the <a href="http://flink.apache.org">Apache Flink</a> Batch runner. In this post we would like to explain what this means for users of Apache Beam and highlight some of the implementation details.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why Beam has PTransforms for everything instead of having methods on PCollection? Take a look at the history that led to this (and other) design decisions.</p>

<p>Are you interested in giving a presentation about Apache Beam? Perhaps you want to talk about Apache Beam at a local Meetup or a convention. Excellent!  The Apache Beam community is excited to expand and grow the community. To help kickstart this process, we are excited to announce an initial set of <a href="/contribute/presentation-materials/">Apache Beam presentation materials</a> which anyone can use to give a presentation about Apache Beam.</p>

<p>One of the major benefits of Apache Beam is the fact that it unifies both
both batch and stream processing into one powerful model. In fact, this unification
is so important, the name Beam itself comes from the union of <strong>B</strong>atch + str<strong>EAM</strong> = Beam</p>

<p>When the project started, we wanted a logo which was both appealing and visually
represented this unification.</p>
