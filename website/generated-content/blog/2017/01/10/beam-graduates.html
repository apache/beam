<p>Today, the Apache Software Foundation <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-announces">announced</a>
that Apache Beam has successfully graduated from incubation, becoming a new
Top-Level Project at the foundation and signifying that its “community and
products have been well-governed under the foundation’s meritocratic process
and principles”.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Graduation is an exciting milestone for Apache Beam. Becoming a top-level
project is a recognition of the amazing growth of the Apache Beam community,
both in terms of size and diversity. It is fantastic to see ever-increasing
participation on our development and user mailing lists, in pull requests,
and at conferences and meetups. Contributions of additional runners and IO
connectors further show the significant interest from other projects and
organizations in being part of our growing community.</p>

<p>Although graduation is a statement about community, our technical progress has
also been impressive. We started with code donations from several companies
that were tailored with a specific vendor and scenario in mind and had fragile
component boundaries. The whole community worked extremely hard over the past
year to refactor the codebase and documentation into a truly vendor-neutral and
extensible framework. We have established an impressive engineering system and
processes that promote test-driven development. This concerted focus on quality
and execution excellence enabled us to publish four releases, each significantly
better than the previous.</p>

<p>Going forward, we will continue to extend the core abstractions to distill
additional complex data processing patterns into intuitive APIs, and, at the
same time, enhance the ability to interconnect additional storage/messaging
systems and execution engines. Together, we are excited to push forward the
state of the art in distributed data processing.</p>

<p>This is also an opportunity to thank those who helped and supported us reaching
this milestone. None of this would be possible without the Apache Software
Foundation and its amazing volunteers who have wholeheartedly welcomed us into
the family. In particular, we’d like to thank the Apache Incubator community
for their guidance producing releases and following processes. We are especially
thankful to the Apache Infra team for their assistance establishing Beam’s
engineering system, particularly in the areas of testing infrastructure and
development productivity.</p>

<p>On behalf of the whole Apache Beam community, thank you to our incubation
mentors Ted Dunning, Venkatesh Seetharam, and, previously, Bertrand Delacretaz
and Jim Jagielski, for teaching us the Apache Way and guiding us through
incubation. In particular, special thanks goes to our incubation champion and
mentor Jean-Baptiste Onofré, whose extraordinary help, day after day, was
instrumental in getting us here, and who continues as an active code contributor
and a member of the project management committee.</p>

<p>Please consider joining us, whether as a user or a contributor, as we work
towards our first release with API stability. If you’d like to try out Apache
Beam today, check out the latest
<a href="/get-started/downloads/">0.4.0 release</a>. We welcome
contribution and participation from anyone through our mailing lists, issue
tracker, pull requests, and events.</p>
