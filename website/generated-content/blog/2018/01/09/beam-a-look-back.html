<p>On January 10, 2017, Apache Beam got <a href="/blog/2017/01/10/beam-graduates.html">promoted</a>
as a Top-Level Apache Software Foundation project. It was an important milestone
that validated the value of the project, legitimacy of its community, and
heralded its growing adoption. In the past year, Apache Beam has been on a
phenomenal growth trajectory, with significant growth in its community and
feature set. Let us walk you through some of the notable achievements.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>

<p>First, lets take a glimpse at how Beam was used in 2017. Apache Beam being a
unified framework for batch and stream processing, enables a very wide spectrum
of diverse use cases. Here are some use cases that exemplify the versatility of
Beam.</p>

<p><img class="center-block" src="/images/blog/2017-look-back/timeline.png" alt="Use Cases" width="600" /></p>

<h2 id="community-growth">Community growth</h2>

<p>In 2017, Apache Beam had 174 contributors worldwide, from many different
organizations. As an Apache project, we are proud to count 18 PMC members and
31 committers. The community had 7 releases in 2017, each bringing a rich set of
new features and fixes.</p>

<p>The most obvious and encouraging sign of the growth of Apache Beam’s community,
and validation of its core value proposition of portability, is the addition of
significant new <a href="/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/">runners</a>
(i.e. execution engines). We entered 2017 with Apache Flink, Apache Spark 1.x,
Google Cloud Dataflow, Apache Apex, and Apache Gearpump. In 2017, the following
new and updated runners were developed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apache Spark 2.x update</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/10/streaming-analytics-updates-ibm-streams-runner-apache-beam-2-0/">IBM Streams runner</a></li>
  <li>MapReduce runner</li>
  <li><a href="http://jstorm.io/">JStorm runner</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to runners, Beam added new IO connectors, some notable ones being
the Cassandra, MQTT, AMQP, HBase/HCatalog, JDBC, Solr, Tika, Redis, and
ElasticSearch connectors. Beam’s IO connectors make it possible to read from or
write to data sources/sinks even when they are not natively supported by the
underlying execution engine. Beam also provides fully pluggable filesystem
support, allowing us to support and extend our coverage to HDFS, S3, Azure
Storage, and Google Storage. We continue to add new IO connectors and
filesystems to extend the Beam use cases.</p>

<p>A particularly telling sign of the maturity of an open source community is when
it is able to collaborate with multiple other open source communities, and
mutually improve the state of the art. Over the past few months, the Beam,
Calcite, and Flink communities have come together to define a robust <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wrla8mF_mmq-NW9sdJHYVgMyZsgCmHumJJ5f5WUzTiM/edit">spec</a>
for Streaming SQL, with engineers from over four organizations contributing to
it. If, like us, you are excited by the prospect of improving the state of
streaming SQL, please join us!</p>

<p>In addition to SQL, new XML and JSON based declarative DSLs are also in PoC.</p>

<h2 id="continued-innovation">Continued innovation</h2>

<p>Innovation is important to the success on any open source project, and Beam has
a rich history of bringing innovative new ideas to the open source community.
Apache Beam was the first to introduce some seminal concepts in the world of
big-data processing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unified batch and streaming SDK that enables users to author big-data jobs
without having to learn multiple disparate SDKs/APIs.</li>
  <li>Cross-Engine Portability: Giving enterprises the confidence that workloads
authored today will not have to be re-written when open source engines become
outdated and are supplanted by newer ones.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101">Semantics</a>
essential for reasoning about unbounded unordered data, and achieving
consistent and correct output from a streaming job.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2017, the pace of innovation continued. The following capabilities were
introduced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-Language Portability framework, and a <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> SDK
developed with it.</li>
  <li>Dynamically Shardable IO (SplittableDoFn)</li>
  <li>Support for schemas in PCollection, allowing us to extend the runner
capabilities.</li>
  <li>Extensions addressing new use cases such as machine learning, and new data
formats.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="areas-of-improvement">Areas of improvement</h2>

<p>Any retrospective view of a project is incomplete without an honest assessment
of areas of improvement. Two aspects stand out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helping runners showcase their individual strengths. After all, portability
does not imply homogeneity. Different runners have different areas in which
they excel, and we need to do a better job of helping them highlight their
strengths.</li>
  <li>Based on the previous point, helping customers make a more informed decision
when they select a runner or migrate from one to another.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2018, we aim to take proactive steps to improve the above aspects.</p>

<h2 id="ethos-of-the-project-and-its-community">Ethos of the project and its community</h2>

<p>The world of batch and stream big-data processing today is reminiscent of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a> parable: a
slowdown of progress because different communities spoke different languages.
Similarly, today there are multiple disparate big-data SDKs/APIs, each with
their own distinct terminology to describe similar concepts. The side effect is
user confusion and slower adoption.</p>

<p>The Apache Beam project aims to provide an industry standard portable SDK that
will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Benefit users by providing <strong><em>innovation with stability</em></strong>: The separation of
SDK and engine enables healthy competition between runners, without requiring
users to constantly learn new SDKs/APIs and rewrite their workloads to
benefit from new innovation.</li>
  <li>Benefit big-data engines by <strong><em>growing the pie for everyone</em></strong>: Making it
easier for users to author, maintain, upgrade and migrate their big-data
workloads will lead to significant growth in the number of production
big-data deployments.</li>
</ul>
