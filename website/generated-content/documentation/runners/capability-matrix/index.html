  <title>Apache Beam Capability Matrix</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Apache Beam is an open source, unified model and set of language-specific SDKs for defining and executing data processing workflows, and also data ingestion and integration flows, supporting Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). Dataflow pipelines simplify the mechanics of large-scale batch and streaming data processing and can run on a number of runtimes like Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow (a cloud service). Beam also brings DSL in different languages, allowing users to easily implement their data integration processes.

<h1 id="beam-capability-matrix">Beam Capability Matrix</h1>
<p>Apache Beam provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed across a diversity of execution engines, or <i>runners</i>. The core concepts of this layer are based upon the Beam Model (formerly referred to as the <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf">Dataflow Model</a>), and implemented to varying degrees in each Beam runner. To help clarify the capabilities of individual runners, weâ€™ve created the capability matrix below.</p>

<p>Individual capabilities have been grouped by their corresponding <span class="wwwh-what-dark">What</span> / <span class="wwwh-where-dark">Where</span> / <span class="wwwh-when-dark">When</span> / <span class="wwwh-how-dark">How</span> question:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="wwwh-what-dark">What</span> results are being calculated?</li>
  <li><span class="wwwh-where-dark">Where</span> in event time?</li>
  <li><span class="wwwh-when-dark">When</span> in processing time?</li>
  <li><span class="wwwh-how-dark">How</span> do refinements of results relate?</li>
</ul>

<p>For more details on the <span class="wwwh-what-dark">What</span> / <span class="wwwh-where-dark">Where</span> / <span class="wwwh-when-dark">When</span> / <span class="wwwh-how-dark">How</span> breakdown of concepts, we recommend reading through the <a href="http://oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102">Streaming 102</a> post on Oâ€™Reilly Radar.</p>

<p>Note that in the future, we intend to add additional tables beyond the current set, for things like runtime characterstics (e.g. at-least-once vs exactly-once), performance, etc.</p>
