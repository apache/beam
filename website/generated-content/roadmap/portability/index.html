  <meta name="description" content="Apache Beam is an open source, unified model and set of language-specific SDKs for defining and executing data processing workflows, and also data ingestion and integration flows, supporting Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). Dataflow pipelines simplify the mechanics of large-scale batch and streaming data processing and can run on a number of runtimes like Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow (a cloud service). Beam also brings DSL in different languages, allowing users to easily implement their data integration processes.

<h1 id="portability-framework-roadmap">Portability Framework Roadmap</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Interoperability between SDKs and runners is a key aspect of Apache
Beam. So far, however, the reality is that most runners support the
Java SDK only, because each SDK-runner combination requires non-trivial
work on both sides. All runners are also currently written in Java,
which makes support of non-Java SDKs far more expensive. The
<em>portability framework</em> aims to rectify this situation and provide
full interoperability across the Beam ecosystem.</p>

<p>The portability framework introduces well-defined, language-neutral
data structures and protocols between the SDK and runner. This interop
layer – called the <em>portability API</em> – ensures that SDKs and runners
can work with each other uniformly, reducing the interoperability
burden for both SDKs and runners to a constant effort.  It notably
ensures that <em>new</em> SDKs automatically work with existing runners and
vice versa.  The framework introduces a new runner, the <em>Universal
Local Runner (ULR)</em>, as a practical reference implementation that
complements the direct runners. Finally, it enables cross-language
pipelines (sharing I/O or transformations across SDKs) and
user-customized execution environments (“custom containers”).</p>

<p>The portability API consists of a set of smaller contracts that
isolate SDKs and runners for job submission, management and
execution. These contracts use protobufs and gRPC for broad language
support.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Job submission and management</strong>: The <em>Runner API</em> defines a
language-neutral pipeline representation with transformations
specifying the execution environment as a docker container
image. The latter both allows the execution side to set up the
right environment as well as opens the door for custom containers
and cross-environment pipelines. The <em>Job API</em> allows pipeline
execution and configuration to be managed uniformly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Job execution</strong>: The <em>SDK harness</em> is a SDK-provided
program responsible for executing user code and is run separately
from the runner.  The <em>Fn API</em> defines an execution-time binary
contract between the SDK harness and the runner that describes how
execution tasks are managed and how data is transferred. In
addition, the runner needs to handle progress and monitoring in an
efficient and language-neutral way. SDK harness initialization
relies on the <em>Provision</em> and <em>Artifact APIs</em> for obtaining staged
files, pipeline options and environment information. Docker
provides isolation between the runner and SDK/user environments to
the benefit of both as defined by the <em>container contract</em>. The
containerization of the SDK gives it (and the user, unless the SDK
is closed) full control over its own environment without risk of
dependency conflicts. The runner has significant freedom regarding
how it manages the SDK harness containers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is that all (non-direct) runners and SDKs eventually support
the portability API, perhaps exclusively.</p>

<p>If you are interested in digging in to the designs, you can find
them on the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Apache+Beam">Beam developers’ wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="milestones">Milestones</h2>

<p>The portability framework is a substantial effort that touches every
Beam component. In addition to the sheer magnitude, a major challenge
is engineering an interop layer that does not significantly compromise
performance due to the additional serialization overhead of a
language-neutral protocol.</p>

<p>The proposed project phases are roughly as follows and are not
strictly sequential, as various components will likely move at
different speeds. Additionally, there have been (and continues to be)
supporting refactorings that are not always tracked as part of the
portability effort. Work already done is not tracked here either.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>P1 [MVP]</strong>: Implement the fundamental plumbing for portable SDKs
and runners for batch and streaming, including containers and the
ULR
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2899">BEAM-2899</a>]. Each
SDK and runner should use the portability framework at least to the
extent that wordcount
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2896">BEAM-2896</a>] and
windowed wordcount
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2941">BEAM-2941</a>] run
portably.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>P2 [Feature complete]</strong>: Design and implement portability support
for remaining execution-side features, so that any pipeline from
any SDK can run portably on any runner. These features include side
inputs
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2863">BEAM-2863</a>], User state [<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2862">BEAM-2862</a>], User
timers
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2925">BEAM-2925</a>],
Splittable DoFn
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2896">BEAM-2896</a>] and
more.  Each SDK and runner should use the portability framework at
least to the extent that the mobile gaming examples
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2940">BEAM-2940</a>] run
portably.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>P3 [Performance]</strong>: Measure and tune performance of portable
pipelines using benchmarks such as Nexmark. Features such as
progress reporting
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2940">BEAM-2940</a>],
combiner lifting
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2937">BEAM-2937</a>] and
fusion are expected to be needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>P4 [Cross language]</strong>: Design and implement cross-language
pipeline support, including how the ecosystem of shared transforms
should work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>The portability effort touches every component, so the “portability”
label is used to identify all portability-related issues. Pure
design or proto definitions should use the “beam-model” component. A
common pattern for new portability features is that the overall
feature is in “beam-model” with subtasks for each SDK and runner in
their respective components.</p>

<p><strong>JIRA:</strong> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project %3D BEAM AND resolution %3D Unresolved AND labels %3D portability order by priority DESC%2Cupdated DESC">query</a></p>

<h2 id="status">Status</h2>

<p>MVP, and FeatureCompletness nearly done (missing SDF, timers) for
SDKs, Python ULR, and shared java runners library.
Flink is the first runner to fully leverage this, with focus moving to
Performance.
See the
<a href="https://s.apache.org/apache-beam-portability-support-table">Portability support table</a>
for details.</p>

<h3 id="python-on-flink">Running Python wordcount on Flink or Spark</h3>

<p>Currently, the Flink and Spark runners support portable pipeline execution.
To run a basic Python wordcount (in batch mode) with embedded Flink or Spark:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run once to build the SDK harness container: <code class="highlighter-rouge">./gradlew :sdks:python:container:docker</code></li>
  <li>Choose one:
    <ul>
      <li>Start the Flink portable JobService endpoint: <code class="highlighter-rouge">./gradlew :runners:flink:1.5:job-server:runShadow</code></li>
      <li>Or start the Spark portable JobService endpoint: <code class="highlighter-rouge">./gradlew :runners:spark:job-server:runShadow</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Submit the wordcount pipeline to above endpoint: <code class="highlighter-rouge">./gradlew :sdks:python:portableWordCount -PjobEndpoint=localhost:8099 -PenvironmentType=LOOPBACK</code></li>
</ol>

<p>To run the pipeline in streaming mode (currently only supported on Flink): <code class="highlighter-rouge">./gradlew :beam-sdks-python:portableWordCount -PjobEndpoint=localhost:8099 -Pstreaming</code></p>

<p>Please see the <a href="/documentation/runners/flink/">Flink Runner page</a> for more information on
how to run portable pipelines on top of Flink.</p>
