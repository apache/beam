&lt;h1 id="go-sdk-roadmap">Go SDK Roadmap&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Go SDK is currently experimental. As the first purely portable Beam SDK, the Go SDK is constrained
by the status of the &lt;a href="https://beam.apache.org/roadmap/portability/">Beam Portability Framework&lt;/a> and the existence of
portable runners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>April 2020 Update&lt;/strong>
This year we hope to move the SDK out of experimental at least for Batch usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do so, there are a few blocking changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support Interoperability with other SDKs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scalable IOs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Portability Proto stability&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go Ecosystem integration improvements&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Interoperability while not a blocking feature in itself, requires Beam Schema support, which
the SDK could then use as it&amp;rsquo;s default coder. Batch Splittable DoFns are nearly ready for
playing with on Flink, and the Python Direct Runner, answering the scalable batch IO question.
There&amp;rsquo;s much work getting the portability protos to a stable baseline. This will allow runner
and SDK independance, so they don&amp;rsquo;t need to be updated in lockstep. Finally, the Go SDK should
adopt Go Modules as it&amp;rsquo;s versioning solution, and officially &amp;ldquo;catch up&amp;rdquo; with the current beam
version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Go SDK has the following goals for the next few months:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="usability">Usability&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Beam Schema Support &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4124">BEAM-9615&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improvements to starcgen &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9616">BEAM-9616&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="integrating-with-the-go-ecosystem">Integrating with the Go ecosystem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The authors of the Go SDK intended to keep the parts of the language we love, and intend for
user pipelines to be as close to ordinary Go as possible, minimizing framework boiler plate code.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Migrate to a vanity URL path &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4115">BEAM-4115&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Package versioning support &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5379">BEAM-5379&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="implement-portability-features">Implement Portability features&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following are dependant on the features being implemented in the Portability Framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Splitable DoFns (SDFs) for Scalable IO &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3301">BEAM-3301&lt;/a>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This is the primary blocker for the Go SDK to scale to ingest large numbers of elements in both batch and streaming.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Triggers and Timers &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3304">BEAM-3304&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advanced WindowFns
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Session windows &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4152">BEAM-4152&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Custom WindowFns (dependant on streaming Splitable DoFn support) &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2939">BEAM-2939&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Without SDFs, IOs are always constrained to work on a single machine prior to a sharding operation (like CoGroupByKey),
which makes scalable IOs difficult to impossible to write.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, improving examples and documentation for devs and users alike is ongoing.

&lt;p>Connector-related efforts that will benefit multiple SDKs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="splittable-dofn">Splittable DoFn&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Splittable DoFn is the next generation sources framework for Beam that will
replace current frameworks for developing bounded and unbounded sources.
Splittable DoFn is being developed along side current Beam portability
efforts. See &lt;a href="https://beam.apache.org/roadmap/portability/">Beam portability framework roadmap&lt;/a> for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="cross-language-transforms">Cross-language transforms&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Last updated on May 2020.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an added benefit of Beam portability effort, we are able to utilize Beam transforms across SDKs. This has many benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Connector sharing across SDKs. For example,
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Beam pipelines written using Python and Go SDKs will be able to utilize the vast selection of connectors that are currently implemented for Java SDK.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Java SDK will be able to utilize connectors for systems that only offer a Python API.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go SDK, will be able to utilize connectors currently available for Java and Python SDKs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ease of developing and maintaining Beam transforms - in general, with cross-language transforms, Beam transform authors will be able to implement new Beam transforms using a
language of choice and utilize these transforms from other languages reducing the maintenance and support overheads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/sql/overview/">Beam SQL&lt;/a>, that is currently only available to Java SDK, will become available to Python and Go SDKs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/get_started">Beam TFX transforms&lt;/a>, that are currently only available to Beam Python SDK pipelines will become available to Java and Go SDKs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h1 id="portability-framework-roadmap">Portability Framework Roadmap&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Interoperability between SDKs and runners is a key aspect of Apache
Beam. So far, however, the reality is that most runners support the
Java SDK only, because each SDK-runner combination requires non-trivial
work on both sides. All runners are also currently written in Java,
which makes support of non-Java SDKs far more expensive. The
&lt;em>portability framework&lt;/em> aims to rectify this situation and provide
full interoperability across the Beam ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The portability framework introduces well-defined, language-neutral
data structures and protocols between the SDK and runner. This interop
layer &amp;ndash; called the &lt;em>portability API&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; ensures that SDKs and runners
can work with each other uniformly, reducing the interoperability
burden for both SDKs and runners to a constant effort. It notably
ensures that &lt;em>new&lt;/em> SDKs automatically work with existing runners and
vice versa. The framework introduces a new runner, the &lt;em>Universal
Local Runner (ULR)&lt;/em>, as a practical reference implementation that
complements the direct runners. Finally, it enables cross-language
pipelines (sharing I/O or transformations across SDKs) and
user-customized &lt;a href="/documentation/runtime/environments/">execution environments&lt;/a>
(&amp;ldquo;custom containers&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The portability API consists of a set of smaller contracts that
isolate SDKs and runners for job submission, management and
execution. These contracts use protobufs and &lt;a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC&lt;/a> for broad language
support.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Job submission and management&lt;/strong>: The &lt;em>Runner API&lt;/em> defines a
language-neutral pipeline representation with transformations
specifying the execution environment as a docker container
image. The latter both allows the execution side to set up the
right environment as well as opens the door for custom containers
and cross-environment pipelines. The &lt;em>Job API&lt;/em> allows pipeline
execution and configuration to be managed uniformly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Job execution&lt;/strong>: The &lt;em>SDK harness&lt;/em> is a SDK-provided
program responsible for executing user code and is run separately
from the runner. The &lt;em>Fn API&lt;/em> defines an execution-time binary
contract between the SDK harness and the runner that describes how
execution tasks are managed and how data is transferred. In
addition, the runner needs to handle progress and monitoring in an
efficient and language-neutral way. SDK harness initialization
relies on the &lt;em>Provision&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Artifact APIs&lt;/em> for obtaining staged
files, pipeline options and environment information. Docker
provides isolation between the runner and SDK/user environments to
the benefit of both as defined by the &lt;em>container contract&lt;/em>. The
containerization of the SDK gives it (and the user, unless the SDK
is closed) full control over its own environment without risk of
dependency conflicts. The runner has significant freedom regarding
how it manages the SDK harness containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The goal is that all (non-direct) runners and SDKs eventually support
the portability API, perhaps exclusively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested in digging in to the designs, you can find
them on the &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Design+Documents">Beam developers&amp;rsquo; wiki&lt;/a>.
Another overview can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yg8Xm4fb-oRjiLQjwLt5153hpwwTLclZrVOKP2hQifo/edit#slide=id.g42e4c9aad6_1_3070">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="milestones">Milestones&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The portability framework is a substantial effort that touches every
Beam component. In addition to the sheer magnitude, a major challenge
is engineering an interop layer that does not significantly compromise
performance due to the additional serialization overhead of a
language-neutral protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proposed project phases are roughly as follows and are not
strictly sequential, as various components will likely move at
different speeds. Additionally, there have been (and continues to be)
supporting refactorings that are not always tracked as part of the
portability effort. Work already done is not tracked here either.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>P1 [MVP]&lt;/strong>: Implement the fundamental plumbing for portable SDKs
and runners for batch and streaming, including containers and the
ULR
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2899">BEAM-2899&lt;/a>]. Each
SDK and runner should use the portability framework at least to the
extent that wordcount
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2896">BEAM-2896&lt;/a>] and
windowed wordcount
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2941">BEAM-2941&lt;/a>] run
portably.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>P2 [Feature complete]&lt;/strong>: Design and implement portability support
for remaining execution-side features, so that any pipeline from
any SDK can run portably on any runner. These features include side
inputs
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2863">BEAM-2863&lt;/a>], User state [&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2862">BEAM-2862&lt;/a>], User
timers
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2925">BEAM-2925&lt;/a>],
Splittable DoFn
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2896">BEAM-2896&lt;/a>] and
more. Each SDK and runner should use the portability framework at
least to the extent that the mobile gaming examples
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2940">BEAM-2940&lt;/a>] run
portably.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>P3 [Performance]&lt;/strong>: Measure and tune performance of portable
pipelines using benchmarks such as Nexmark. Features such as
progress reporting
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2940">BEAM-2940&lt;/a>],
combiner lifting
[&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2937">BEAM-2937&lt;/a>] and
fusion are expected to be needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>P4 [Cross language]&lt;/strong>: Design and implement cross-language
pipeline support, including how the ecosystem of shared transforms
should work.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="issues">Issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The portability effort touches every component, so the &amp;ldquo;portability&amp;rdquo;
label is used to identify all portability-related issues. Pure
design or proto definitions should use the &amp;ldquo;beam-model&amp;rdquo; component. A
common pattern for new portability features is that the overall
feature is in &amp;ldquo;beam-model&amp;rdquo; with subtasks for each SDK and runner in
their respective components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>JIRA:&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20BEAM%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20portability%20order%20by%20priority%20DESC%2Cupdated%20DESC">query&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="status">Status&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>MVP, and FeatureCompletness nearly done for
SDKs, Python ULR, and shared java runners library.
Performance is good and multi-language pipelines are supported.
Currently, the Flink and Spark runners support portable pipeline execution,
as does Dataflow when using the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/deploying-a-pipeline#dataflow-runner-v2">Dataflow Runner v2&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>The Apache Beam community voted to join &lt;a href="https://python3statement.org/">the pledge&lt;/a> to sunset Python 2 support in 2020. The Beam community will discontinue Python 2 support in 2020 and cannot guarantee long-term functional support or maintenance of Beam on Python 2. To ensure minimal disruption to your service, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to Python 3 as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="python-3-support">Python 3 Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Apache Beam 2.14.0 and higher support Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.
