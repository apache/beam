&lt;p>Roadmap for connectors developed using Go SDK.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go SDK plans to utilize currently available Java and Python connectors
through cross-language transforms feature.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>KafkaIO via Java - DONE&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BigQuery via Java - In Progress&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beam SQL via Java&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Go SDK supports SplittableDoFns for bounded pipelines, so scalable bounded pipelines are possible.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The textio package supports &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/pkg/beam/io/textio#ReadSdf">ReadSdf&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/pkg/beam/io/textio#ReadAllSdf">ReadAllSdf&lt;/a> for efficient batch text reads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A general FileIO will be produced to simplify adding new file based connectors.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Connector-related efforts that will benefit multiple SDKs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="splittable-dofn">Splittable DoFn&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Splittable DoFn is the next generation sources framework for Beam that will
replace current frameworks for developing bounded and unbounded sources.
Splittable DoFn is being developed along side current Beam portability
efforts. See &lt;a href="/roadmap/portability/">Beam portability framework roadmap&lt;/a> for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="cross-language-transforms">Cross-language transforms&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Last updated on May 2020.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an added benefit of Beam portability effort, we are able to utilize Beam transforms across SDKs. This has many benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Connector sharing across SDKs. For example,
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Beam pipelines written using Python and Go SDKs will be able to utilize the vast selection of connectors that are currently implemented for Java SDK.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Java SDK will be able to utilize connectors for systems that only offer a Python API.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go SDK, will be able to utilize connectors currently available for Java and Python SDKs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ease of developing and maintaining Beam transforms - in general, with cross-language transforms, Beam transform authors will be able to implement new Beam transforms using a
language of choice and utilize these transforms from other languages reducing the maintenance and support overheads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="/documentation/dsls/sql/overview/">Beam SQL&lt;/a>, that is currently only available to Java SDK, will become available to Python and Go SDKs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/get_started">Beam TFX transforms&lt;/a>, that are currently only available to Beam Python SDK pipelines will become available to Java and Go SDKs.&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="portability-framework-roadmap">Portability Framework Roadmap&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Interoperability between SDKs and runners is a key aspect of Apache
Beam. Previously, the reality was that most runners supported the
Java SDK only, because each SDK-runner combination required non-trivial
work on both sides. Most runners are also currently written in Java,
which makes support of non-Java SDKs far more expensive. The
&lt;em>portability framework&lt;/em> rectified this situation and provided
full interoperability across the Beam ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The portability framework introduces well-defined, language-neutral
data structures and protocols between the SDK and runner. This interop
layer &amp;ndash; called the &lt;em>portability API&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; ensures that SDKs and runners
can work with each other uniformly, reducing the interoperability
burden for both SDKs and runners to a constant effort. It notably
ensures that &lt;em>new&lt;/em> SDKs automatically work with existing runners and
vice versa. The framework introduces a new runner, the &lt;em>Universal
Local Runner (ULR)&lt;/em>, as a practical reference implementation that
complements the direct runners. Finally, it enables cross-language
pipelines (sharing I/O or transformations across SDKs) and
user-customized &lt;a href="/documentation/runtime/environments/">execution environments&lt;/a>
(&amp;ldquo;custom containers&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The portability API consists of a set of smaller contracts that
isolate SDKs and runners for job submission, management and
execution. These contracts use protobufs and &lt;a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC&lt;/a> for broad language
support.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Job submission and management&lt;/strong>: The &lt;em>Runner API&lt;/em> defines a
language-neutral pipeline representation with transformations
specifying the execution environment as a docker container
image. The latter both allows the execution side to set up the
right environment as well as opens the door for custom containers
and cross-environment pipelines. The &lt;em>Job API&lt;/em> allows pipeline
execution and configuration to be managed uniformly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Job execution&lt;/strong>: The &lt;em>SDK harness&lt;/em> is a SDK-provided
program responsible for executing user code and is run separately
from the runner. The &lt;em>Fn API&lt;/em> defines an execution-time binary
contract between the SDK harness and the runner that describes how
execution tasks are managed and how data is transferred. In
addition, the runner needs to handle progress and monitoring in an
efficient and language-neutral way. SDK harness initialization
relies on the &lt;em>Provision&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Artifact APIs&lt;/em> for obtaining staged
files, pipeline options and environment information. Docker
provides isolation between the runner and SDK/user environments to
the benefit of both as defined by the &lt;em>container contract&lt;/em>. The
containerization of the SDK gives it (and the user, unless the SDK
is closed) full control over its own environment without risk of
dependency conflicts. The runner has significant freedom regarding
how it manages the SDK harness containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The goal is that all (non-direct) runners and SDKs eventually support
the portability API, perhaps exclusively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested in digging in to the designs, you can find
them on the &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Design+Documents">Beam developers&amp;rsquo; wiki&lt;/a>.
Another overview can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yg8Xm4fb-oRjiLQjwLt5153hpwwTLclZrVOKP2hQifo/edit#slide=id.g42e4c9aad6_1_3070">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="status">Status&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All SDKs currently support the portability framework.
There is also a Python Universal Local Runner and shared java runners library.
Performance is good and multi-language pipelines are supported.
Currently, the Flink and Spark runners support portable pipeline execution
(which is used by default for SDKs other than Java),
as does Dataflow when using the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/deploying-a-pipeline#dataflow-runner-v2">Dataflow Runner v2&lt;/a>.
See the
&lt;a href="https://s.apache.org/apache-beam-portability-support-table">Portability support table&lt;/a>
for details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="issues">Issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The portability effort touches every component, so the &amp;ldquo;portability&amp;rdquo;
label is used to identify all portability-related issues. Pure
design or proto definitions should use the &amp;ldquo;beam-model&amp;rdquo; component. A
common pattern for new portability features is that the overall
feature is in &amp;ldquo;beam-model&amp;rdquo; with subtasks for each SDK and runner in
their respective components.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="apache-beam-prism-runner-roadmap">Apache Beam Prism Runner Roadmap&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The goal for the Prism runner is to provide a good default onboarding experience for Apache Beam.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prism should be able to execute any Beam pipeline that can execute on a local machine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prism should be fast to start and execute pipelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prism should be able to assist with the local testing and debugging of pipelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prism may develop into a robust, production ready runner for pipelines that can execute locally.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The detailed roadmap lives in an &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/29650">umbrella tracking issue in Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="sunsetting-python-2-support">Sunsetting Python 2 Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Apache Beam community voted to join &lt;a href="https://python3statement.org/">the pledge&lt;/a> to sunset Python 2 support in 2020. The Beam community will discontinue Python 2 support in 2020 and cannot guarantee long-term functional support or maintenance of Beam on Python 2. To ensure minimal disruption to your service, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to Python 3 as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="python-3-support">Python 3 Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Apache Beam 2.14.0 and higher support Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7. We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1251?focusedCommentId=16890504&amp;amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-1689050">improve&lt;/a> the experience for Python 3 users and add support for Python 3.x minor versions (&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8494">BEAM-8494&lt;/a>):&lt;/p>
