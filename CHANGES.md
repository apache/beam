# [2.21.0] - Unreleased

## Highlights

## I/Os

## New Features / Improvements
* Python SDK will now use Python 3 type annotations as pipeline type hints.
([#10717](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10717))

    If you suspect that this feature is causing your pipeline to fail, calling
    `apache_beam.typehints.disable_type_annotations()` before pipeline creation
    will disable is completely, and decorating specific functions (such as 
    `process()`) with `@apache_beam.typehints.no_annotations` will disable it
    for that function.

    More details will be in 
    [Ensuring Python Type Safety](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-type-safety/)
    and an upcoming
    [blog post](https://beam.apache.org/blog/python/typing/2020/03/06/python-typing.html).

## Breaking Changes

* HBaseIO.ReadAll now requires a PCollection of HBaseIO.Read objects instead of HBaseQuery objects ([BEAM-9279](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9279)).
* ProcessContext.updateWatermark has been removed in favor of using a WatermarkEstimator ([BEAM-9430](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9430)).

## Deprecations

# [2.20.0] - Unreleased

## Highlights


## I/Os

* Java SDK: Adds support for Thrift encoded data via ThriftIO. ([BEAM-8561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8561))
* Java SDK: KafkaIO supports schema resolution using Confluent Schema Registry. ([BEAM-7310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7310))
* Python SDK: Support for Google Cloud Spanner. This is an experimental module for reading and writing data from Google Cloud Spanner ([BEAM-7246](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7246)).
* Python SDK: Adds support for standard HDFS URLs (with server name). ([#10223](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10223)).


## New Features / Improvements

* New AnnotateVideo & AnnotateVideoWithContext PTransform's that integrates GCP Video Intelligence functionality. (Python) ([BEAM-9146](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9146))
* New AnnotateImage & AnnotateImageWithContext PTransform's for element-wise & batch image annotation using Google Cloud Vision API. (Python) ([BEAM-9247](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9247))
* Added a PTransform for inspection and deidentification of text using Google Cloud DLP. (Python) ([BEAM-9258](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9258))
* New AnnotateText PTransform that integrates Google Cloud Natural Language functionality (Python) ([BEAM-9248](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9248))
* _ReadFromBigQuery_ now supports value providers for the query string (Python) ([BEAM-9305](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9305))
* Added ability to write to BigQuery via Avro file loads (Python) ([BEAM-8841](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8841))

* Support for _@RequiresTimeSortedInput_ in Flink and Spark (Java) ([BEAM-8550](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8550))

## Breaking Changes

* ReadFromPubSub(topic=<topic>) in Python previously created a subscription under the same project as the topic. Now it will create the subscription under the project specified in pipeline_options. If the project is not specified in pipeline_options, then it will create the subscription under the same project as the topic. ([BEAM-3453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3453)).
* SpannerAccessor in Java is now package-private to reduce API surface. `SpannerConfig.connectToSpanner` has been moved to `SpannerAccessor.create`. ([BEAM-9310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9310)).
* ParquetIO hadoop dependency should be now provided by the users ([BEAM-8616](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8616)).
* Docker images will be deployed to
  [apache/beam](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=apache%2Fbeam&type=image) repositories from 2.20. They
 used to be deployed to
 [apachebeam](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=apachebeam&type=image) repository.
 ([BEAM-9063](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9093))

## Known Issues

* ([BEAM-X](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-X)).
* ([BEAM-9322](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9322)).
