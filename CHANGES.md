# Current version (not yet released; still in development)

## Highlights

 * New highly anticipated feature X added to Python SDK ([BEAM-X](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-X)).
 * New highly anticipated feature Y added to JavaSDK ([BEAM-Y](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-Y)).

### I/Os

* Java SDK: Adds support for Thrift encoded data via ThriftIO. ([BEAM-8561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8561))
* Java SDK: KafkaIO supports schema resolution using Confluent Schema Registry. ([BEAM-7310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7310))
* Python SDK: Support for Google Cloud Spanner. This is an experimental module for reading and writing data from Google Cloud Spanner ([BEAM-7246](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7246)).
* Python SDK: Adds support for standard HDFS URLs (with server name). ([#10223](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10223)).
* Support for X source added (Java/Python) ([BEAM-X](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-X)).

### New Features / Improvements

* X feature added (Java/Python) ([BEAM-X](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-X)).
* New AnnotateVideo & AnnotateVideoWithContext PTransform's that integrates GCP Video Intelligence functionality. (Python) ([BEAM-9146](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9146))
* New AnnotateImage & AnnotateImageWithContext PTransform's for element-wise & batch image annotation using Google Cloud Vision API. (Python) ([BEAM-9247](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9247))
* Added a PTransform for inspection and deidentification of text using Google Cloud DLP. (Python) ([BEAM-9258](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9258))
* Added ability to write to BigQuery via Avro file loads (Python)([BEAM-8841](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8841))

### Breaking Changes

* ReadFromPubSub(topic=<topic>) in Python previously created a subscription under the same project as the topic. Now it will create the subscription under the project specified in pipeline_options. If the project is not specified in pipeline_options, then it will create the subscription under the same project as the topic. ([BEAM-3453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3453)).
* SpannerAccessor in Java is now package-private to reduce API surface. `SpannerConfig.connectToSpanner` has been moved to `SpannerAccessor.create`. ([BEAM-9310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9310)).
* ParquetIO hadoop dependency should be now provided by the users ([BEAM-8616](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8616)).

### Deprecations

* X behavior is deprecated and will be removed in X versions ([BEAM-X](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-X)).

### Bugfixes

* Fixed X (Java/Python) ([BEAM-X](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-X)).
* Fixed exception when running in IPython notebook (Python) ([BEAM-X9277](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9277)).
* Fixed 1833 (Python) ([BEAM-1833](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1833))

### Known Issues

* ([BEAM-X](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-X)).
* ([BEAM-9322](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9322)).
