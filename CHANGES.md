# [2.21.0] - Unreleased (In Progress)

## Highlights

## I/Os
* Python: Deprecated module `apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.v1` has been removed
as the client it uses is out of date and does not support Python 3
([BEAM-9529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9529)).
Please migrate your code to use
[apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.**v1new**](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.v1new.datastoreio.html).
See the updated
[datastore_wordcount](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/cookbook/datastore_wordcount.py)
for example usage.

## New Features / Improvements
* Python SDK will now use Python 3 type annotations as pipeline type hints.
([#10717](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10717))

    If you suspect that this feature is causing your pipeline to fail, calling
    `apache_beam.typehints.disable_type_annotations()` before pipeline creation
    will disable is completely, and decorating specific functions (such as 
    `process()`) with `@apache_beam.typehints.no_annotations` will disable it
    for that function.

    More details will be in 
    [Ensuring Python Type Safety](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-type-safety/)
    and an upcoming
    [blog post](https://beam.apache.org/blog/python/typing/2020/03/06/python-typing.html).

* Java SDK: Introducing the concept of options in Beam Schemaâ€™s. These options add extra 
context to fields and schemas. This replaces the current Beam metadata that is present 
in a FieldType only, options are available in fields and row schemas. Schema options are
fully typed and can contain complex rows. *Remark: Schema aware is still experimental.*
([BEAM-9035](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9035))
* Java SDK: The protobuf extension is fully schema aware and also includes protobuf option
conversion to beam schema options. *Remark: Schema aware is still experimental.*
([BEAM-9044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9044))
* Added ability to write to BigQuery via Avro file loads (Python) ([BEAM-8841](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8841))

    By default, file loads will be done using JSON, but it is possible to
    specify the temp_file_format parameter to perform file exports with AVRO.
    AVRO-based file loads work by exporting Python types into Avro types, so
    to switch to Avro-based loads, you will need to change your data types
    from Json-compatible types (string-type dates and timestamp, long numeric
    values as strings) into Python native types that are written to Avro
    (Python's date, datetime types, decimal, etc). For more information
    see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-avro#avro_conversions.
* Added integration of Java SDK with Google Cloud AI VideoIntelligence service 
([BEAM-9147](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9147))

 
## Breaking Changes

* Dataflow runner now requires the `--region` option to be set, unless a default value is set in the environment ([BEAM-9199](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9199)). See [here](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) for more details.
* HBaseIO.ReadAll now requires a PCollection of HBaseIO.Read objects instead of HBaseQuery objects ([BEAM-9279](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9279)).
* ProcessContext.updateWatermark has been removed in favor of using a WatermarkEstimator ([BEAM-9430](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9430)).
* Coder inference for PCollection of Row objects has been disabled ([BEAM-9569](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9569)).

## Deprecations
* Java SDK: Beam Schema FieldType.getMetadata is now deprecated and is replaced by the Beam
Schema Options, it will be removed in version `2.23.0`. ([BEAM-9704](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9704))

## Known Issues


# [2.20.0] - 2020-04-15

## Highlights


## I/Os

* Java SDK: Adds support for Thrift encoded data via ThriftIO. ([BEAM-8561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8561))
* Java SDK: KafkaIO supports schema resolution using Confluent Schema Registry. ([BEAM-7310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7310))
* Java SDK: Add Google Cloud Healthcare IO connectors: HL7v2IO and FhirIO ([BEAM-9468](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9468))
* Python SDK: Support for Google Cloud Spanner. This is an experimental module for reading and writing data from Google Cloud Spanner ([BEAM-7246](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7246)).
* Python SDK: Adds support for standard HDFS URLs (with server name). ([#10223](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10223)).


## New Features / Improvements

* New AnnotateVideo & AnnotateVideoWithContext PTransform's that integrates GCP Video Intelligence functionality. (Python) ([BEAM-9146](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9146))
* New AnnotateImage & AnnotateImageWithContext PTransform's for element-wise & batch image annotation using Google Cloud Vision API. (Python) ([BEAM-9247](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9247))
* Added a PTransform for inspection and deidentification of text using Google Cloud DLP. (Python) ([BEAM-9258](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9258))
* New AnnotateText PTransform that integrates Google Cloud Natural Language functionality (Python) ([BEAM-9248](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9248))
* _ReadFromBigQuery_ now supports value providers for the query string (Python) ([BEAM-9305](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9305))
* Direct runner for FnApi supports further parallelism (Python) ([BEAM-9228](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9228)) 
* Support for _@RequiresTimeSortedInput_ in Flink and Spark (Java) ([BEAM-8550](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8550))

## Breaking Changes

* ReadFromPubSub(topic=<topic>) in Python previously created a subscription under the same project as the topic. Now it will create the subscription under the project specified in pipeline_options. If the project is not specified in pipeline_options, then it will create the subscription under the same project as the topic. ([BEAM-3453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3453)).
* SpannerAccessor in Java is now package-private to reduce API surface. `SpannerConfig.connectToSpanner` has been moved to `SpannerAccessor.create`. ([BEAM-9310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9310)).
* ParquetIO hadoop dependency should be now provided by the users ([BEAM-8616](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8616)).
* Docker images will be deployed to
  [apache/beam](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=apache%2Fbeam&type=image) repositories from 2.20. They
 used to be deployed to
 [apachebeam](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=apachebeam&type=image) repository.
 ([BEAM-9063](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9093))
* PCollections now have tags inferred from the result type (e.g. the keys of a dict or index of a tuple).  Users may expect the old implementation which gave PCollection output ids a monotonically increasing id. To go back to the old implementation, use the `force_generated_pcollection_output_ids` experiment.

## Deprecations

## Bugfixes

* Fixed numpy operators in ApproximateQuantiles (Python) ([BEAM-9579](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9579)).

* Fixed SyntaxError in process worker startup ([BEAM-9503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9503))
* Key should be available in @OnTimer methods (Java) ([BEAM-1819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1819)).

## Known Issues

* ([BEAM-X](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-X)).
* ([BEAM-9322](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9322)).
* Python SDK `pre_optimize=all` experiment may cause error ([BEAM-9445](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9445))
