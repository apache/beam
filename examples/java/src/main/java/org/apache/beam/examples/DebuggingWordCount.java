/**
 * An example that verifies word counts in Shakespeare and includes Beam best practices.
 *
 * <p>This class, {@link DebuggingWordCount}, is the third in a series of four successively more
 * detailed 'word count' examples. You may first want to take a look at {@link MinimalWordCount}
 * and {@link WordCount}. After you've looked at this example, then see the
 * {@link WindowedWordCount} pipeline, for introduction of additional concepts.
 *
 * <p>Basic concepts, also in the MinimalWordCount and WordCount examples:
 * Reading text files; counting a PCollection; executing a Pipeline both locally
 * and using a selected runner; defining DoFns.
 *
 * <p>New Concepts:
 * <pre>
 *   1. Logging using SLF4J, even in a distributed environment
 *   2. Creating a custom metric (runners have varying levels of support)
 *   3. Testing your Pipeline via PAssert
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>To execute this pipeline locally, specify general pipeline configuration:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>To change the runner, specify:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   --runner=YOUR_SELECTED_RUNNER
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The input file defaults to a public data set containing the text of of King Lear,
 * by William Shakespeare. You can override it and choose your own input with {@code --inputFile}.
 *
