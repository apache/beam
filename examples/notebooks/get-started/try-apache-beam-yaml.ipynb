    "# Try Apache Beam - YAML\n",
    "\n",
    "While Beam provides powerful APIs for authoring sophisticated data processing pipelines, it still has a high barrier for getting started and authoring simple pipelines. Even setting up the environment, installing the dependencies, and setting up the project can be a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide a simple declarative syntax for describing pipelines that does not require coding experience or learning how to use an SDK&mdash;any text editor will do. Some installation may be required to actually *execute* a pipeline, but we envision various services (such as Dataflow) to accept yaml pipelines directly obviating the need for even that in the future. We also anticipate the ability to generate code directly from these higher-level yaml descriptions, should one want to graduate to a full Beam SDK (and possibly the other direction as well as far as possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that everything here is still under development, but any features already included are considered stable. Feedback is welcome at dev@apache.beam.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you set up your development environment and write a simple pipeline using YAML. Then you run it locally, using the [DirectRunner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/). You can explore other runners with the [Beam Capability Matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To navigate through different sections, use the table of contents. From **View**  drop-down list, select **Table of contents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a code cell, click the **Run cell** button at the top left of the cell, or select it and press **`Shift+Enter`**. Try modifying a code cell and re-running it to see what happens.\n",
