    "This notebook shows how to enrich data by using the Apache Beam [enrichment transform](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/enrichment-milvus) with [Milvus](https://milvus.io/). The enrichment transform is an Apache Beam turnkey transform that lets you enrich data by using a key-value lookup. This transform has the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The transform has a built-in Apache Beam handler that interacts with Milvus data during enrichment.\n",
    "- The enrichment transform uses client-side throttling to rate limit the requests. The default retry strategy uses exponential backoff. You can configure rate limiting to suit your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the following search engine optimization use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "A specialized technical search engine company wants to improve its query result relevance by dynamically enriching search results with semantically related content. The example uses a vector database of technical articles and documentation stored in Milvus to enrich incoming user queries. The enriched data is then used to provide users with more comprehensive and contextually relevant search results, especially for complex technical topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "Set up your environment and download dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Apache Beam\n",

Developed originally by Google, it allows developers to write pipelines that can run on multiple engines, such as Apache Flink, Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam uses abstractions like PCollections (data containers) and PTransforms (operations) to define the flow of data. The framework promotes portability through its runner architecture, letting the same pipeline execute on different backends. Support for multiple SDKs, including Java and Python, makes it accessible for a broad audience. Key features include support for event time, windowing, triggers, and stateful processing, which are essential for handling real-time data effectively. Beam is ideal for building ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and machine learning data pipelines. It helps teams focus on logic rather than infrastructure, offering flexibility and scalability in handling unbounded and bounded data sources. Apache Beam also supports a wide range of connectors for both input and output, including Kafka, BigQuery, and JDBC-based systems. This makes it easy to integrate Beam into existing data ecosystems. Developers can build reusable transforms and modularize pipeline logic, improving maintainability and testing.', 3: 'Apache Beam: Unified Model for Batch and Streaming Data. Apache Beam is an open-source framework that provides a consistent programming model for both batch and streaming data processing. Developed originally by Google, it allows developers to write pipelines that can run on multiple engines, such as Apache Flink, Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam uses abstractions like PCollections (data containers) and PTransforms (operations) to define the flow of data. The framework promotes portability through its runner architecture, letting the same pipeline execute on different backends. Support for multiple SDKs, including Java and Python, makes it accessible for a broad audience. Key features include support for event time, windowing, triggers, and stateful processing, which are essential for handling real-time data effectively. Beam is ideal for building ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and machine learning data pipelines.

modularize pipeline logic, improving maintainability and testing. The concept of runners enables developers to write once and run anywhere, which is particularly appealing for organizations that want to avoid vendor lock-in. The Beam model is based on a unified programming model that decouples pipeline logic from execution. This makes it easier to reason about time and state in both batch and streaming pipelines. Advanced features like late data handling, watermarks, and session windowing allow for more accurate and meaningful processing of real-world data. Beam also integrates with orchestration tools and monitoring systems, allowing for production-grade deployments. Community support and contributions have grown significantly, making Beam a stable and evolving ecosystem. Many cloud providers offer native support for Beam pipelines, and it's increasingly a core component in modern data platform architectures.\", 3: \"Apache Beam: Unified Model for Batch and Streaming Data.

The Beam model is based on a unified programming model that decouples pipeline logic from execution. This makes it easier to reason about time and state in both batch and streaming pipelines. Advanced features like late data handling, watermarks, and session windowing allow for more accurate and meaningful processing of real-world data. Beam also integrates with orchestration tools and monitoring systems, allowing for production-grade deployments. Community support and contributions have grown significantly, making Beam a stable and evolving ecosystem. Many cloud providers offer native support for Beam pipelines, and it's increasingly a core component in modern data platform architectures.\", 4: \"{'title': 'Apache Beam: Unified Model for Batch and

Developed originally by Google, it allows developers to write pipelines that can run on multiple engines, such as Apache Flink, Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam uses abstractions like PCollections (data containers) and PTransforms (operations) to define the flow of data. The framework promotes portability through its runner architecture, letting the same pipeline execute on different backends. Support for multiple SDKs, including Java and Python, makes it accessible for a broad audience. Key features include support for event time, windowing, triggers, and stateful processing, which are essential for handling real-time data effectively. Beam is ideal for building ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and machine learning data pipelines. It helps teams focus on logic rather than infrastructure, offering flexibility and scalability in handling unbounded and bounded data sources. Apache Beam also supports a wide range of connectors for both input and output, including Kafka, BigQuery, and JDBC-based systems. This makes it easy to integrate Beam into existing data ecosystems. Developers can build reusable transforms and modularize pipeline logic, improving maintainability and testing.\"</span>,\n",

The concept of runners enables developers to write once and run anywhere, which is particularly appealing for organizations that want to avoid vendor lock-in. The Beam model is based on a unified programming model that decouples pipeline logic from execution. This makes it easier to reason about time and state in both batch and streaming pipelines. Advanced features like late data handling, watermarks, and session windowing allow for more accurate and meaningful processing of real-world data. Beam also integrates with orchestration tools and monitoring systems, allowing for production-grade deployments. Community support and contributions have grown significantly, making Beam a stable and evolving ecosystem.

Developed originally by Google, it allows developers to write pipelines that can run on multiple engines, such as Apache Flink, Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam uses abstractions like PCollections (data containers) and PTransforms (operations) to define the flow of data. The framework promotes portability through its runner architecture, letting the same pipeline execute on different backends. Support for multiple SDKs, including Java and Python, makes it accessible for a broad audience. Key features include support for event time, windowing, triggers, and stateful processing, which are essential for handling real-time data effectively. Beam is ideal for building ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and machine learning data pipelines. It helps teams focus on logic rather than infrastructure, offering flexibility and scalability in handling unbounded and bounded data sources. Apache Beam also supports a wide range of connectors for both input and output, including Kafka, BigQuery, and JDBC-based systems. This makes it easy to integrate Beam into existing data ecosystems. Developers can build reusable transforms and modularize pipeline logic, improving maintainability and testing.\"\u001b[0m,\n",

The concept of runners enables developers to write once and run anywhere, which is particularly appealing for organizations that want to avoid vendor lock-in. The Beam model is based on a unified programming model that decouples pipeline logic from execution. This makes it easier to reason about time and state in both batch and streaming pipelines. Advanced features like late data handling, watermarks, and session windowing allow for more accurate and meaningful processing of real-world data. Beam also integrates with orchestration tools and monitoring systems, allowing for production-grade deployments. Community support and contributions have grown significantly, making Beam a stable and evolving ecosystem. Many cloud providers offer native support for Beam pipelines, and it's increasingly a core component in modern data platform architectures.\"\u001b[0m,\n",

This breakthrough makes remote conversations feel natural—capturing facial expressions, eye contact, and subtle gestures that traditional video conferencing often misses. Beam reduces meeting fatigue and enhances engagement, making it ideal for enterprise collaboration, interviews, and virtual presence scenarios.

Developed originally by Google, it allows developers to write pipelines that can run on multiple engines, such as Apache Flink, Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam uses abstractions like PCollections (data containers) and PTransforms (operations) to define the flow of data. The framework promotes portability through its runner architecture, letting the same pipeline execute on different backends. Support for multiple SDKs, including Java and Python, makes it accessible for a broad audience. Key features include support for event time, windowing, triggers, and stateful processing, which are essential for handling real-time data effectively. Beam is ideal for building ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and machine learning data pipelines. It helps teams focus on logic rather than infrastructure, offering flexibility and scalability in handling unbounded and bounded data sources. Apache Beam also supports a wide range of connectors for both input and output, including Kafka, BigQuery, and JDBC-based systems. This makes it easy to integrate Beam into existing data ecosystems. Developers can build reusable transforms and modularize pipeline logic, improving maintainability and testing.\"</span>,\n",

Developed originally by Google, it allows developers to write pipelines that can run on multiple engines, such as Apache Flink, Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam uses abstractions like PCollections (data containers) and PTransforms (operations) to define the flow of data. The framework promotes portability through its runner architecture, letting the same pipeline execute on different backends. Support for multiple SDKs, including Java and Python, makes it accessible for a broad audience. Key features include support for event time, windowing, triggers, and stateful processing, which are essential for handling real-time data effectively. Beam is ideal for building ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and machine learning data pipelines. It helps teams focus on logic rather than infrastructure, offering flexibility and scalability in handling unbounded and bounded data sources. Apache Beam also supports a wide range of connectors for both input and output, including Kafka, BigQuery, and JDBC-based systems. This makes it easy to integrate Beam into existing data ecosystems. Developers can build reusable transforms and modularize pipeline logic, improving maintainability and testing.\"</span>,\n",

The concept of runners enables developers to write once and run anywhere, which is particularly appealing for organizations that want to avoid vendor lock-in. The Beam model is based on a unified programming model that decouples pipeline logic from execution. This makes it easier to reason about time and state in both batch and streaming pipelines. Advanced features like late data handling, watermarks, and session windowing allow for more accurate and meaningful processing of real-world data. Beam also integrates with orchestration tools and monitoring systems, allowing for production-grade deployments. Community support and contributions have grown significantly, making Beam a stable and evolving ecosystem. Many cloud providers offer native support for Beam pipelines, and it's increasingly a core component in modern data platform architectures.\"</span>,\n",

Developed originally by Google, it allows developers to write pipelines that can run on multiple engines, such as Apache Flink, Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam uses abstractions like PCollections (data containers) and PTransforms (operations) to define the flow of data. The framework promotes portability through its runner architecture, letting the same pipeline execute on different backends. Support for multiple SDKs, including Java and Python, makes it accessible for a broad audience. Key features include support for event time, windowing, triggers, and stateful processing, which are essential for handling real-time data effectively. Beam is ideal for building ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and machine learning data pipelines. It helps teams focus on logic rather than infrastructure, offering flexibility and scalability in handling unbounded and bounded data sources. Apache Beam also supports a wide range of connectors for both input and output, including Kafka, BigQuery, and JDBC-based systems. This makes it easy to integrate Beam into existing data ecosystems. Developers can build reusable transforms and modularize pipeline logic, improving maintainability and testing.\"\u001b[0m,\n",

The concept of runners enables developers to write once and run anywhere, which is particularly appealing for organizations that want to avoid vendor lock-in. The Beam model is based on a unified programming model that decouples pipeline logic from execution. This makes it easier to reason about time and state in both batch and streaming pipelines. Advanced features like late data handling, watermarks, and session windowing allow for more accurate and meaningful processing of real-world data. Beam also integrates with orchestration tools and monitoring systems, allowing for production-grade deployments. Community support and contributions have grown significantly, making Beam a stable and evolving ecosystem. Many cloud providers offer native support for Beam pipelines, and it's increasingly a core component in modern data platform architectures.\"\u001b[0m,\n",

    "To precisely target **Apache Beam** and ensure the retrieval of only relevant documents, we can leverage the power of **metadata filtering**. By applying a filter that specifies the document's `keywords` must contain `data pipelines`, we can instruct the undelrying search engine to exclude any documents related to `Google Beam` from the result set. This allows the vector search to operate on a pre-filtered, highly relevant subset of the corpus, guaranteeing that the retrieved information pertains exclusively to `Apache Beam`'s domain, thereby resolving the semantic ambiguity with remarkable precision."

Developed originally by Google, it allows developers to write pipelines that can run on multiple engines, such as Apache Flink, Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam uses abstractions like PCollections (data containers) and PTransforms (operations) to define the flow of data. The framework promotes portability through its runner architecture, letting the same pipeline execute on different backends. Support for multiple SDKs, including Java and Python, makes it accessible for a broad audience. Key features include support for event time, windowing, triggers, and stateful processing, which are essential for handling real-time data effectively. Beam is ideal for building ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and machine learning data pipelines. It helps teams focus on logic rather than infrastructure, offering flexibility and scalability in handling unbounded and bounded data sources. Apache Beam also supports a wide range of connectors for both input and output, including Kafka, BigQuery, and JDBC-based systems. This makes it easy to integrate Beam into existing data ecosystems. Developers can build reusable transforms and modularize pipeline logic, improving maintainability and testing.\"</span>,\n",

    "To precisely target `Google Beam` and ensure the retrieval of only relevant documents, we can leverage the power of `metadata filtering`. By applying a filter that specifies the document's `tags` must contain `Remote Work`, we can instruct the underlying search engine to exclude any documents related to `Apache Beam` from the result set. This allows the vector search to operate on a pre-filtered, highly relevant subset of the corpus, guaranteeing that the retrieved information pertains exclusively to `Google Beam`'s domain, thereby resolving the semantic ambiguity with remarkable precision."

It uses AI, 3D imaging, and light field rendering to create immersive, lifelike video calls. Designed to replicate in-person interaction, Beam allows users to see life-sized, three-dimensional representations of each other without the need for headsets. This breakthrough makes remote conversations feel natural—capturing facial expressions, eye contact, and subtle gestures that traditional video conferencing often misses. Beam reduces meeting fatigue and enhances engagement, making it ideal for enterprise collaboration, interviews, and virtual presence scenarios. Powered by Google AI, Beam represents a significant leap in communication technology. Major companies like Salesforce, Deloitte, and NEC are already exploring its impact on digital collaboration. Google is partnering with HP to build and distribute Beam hardware, designed to work with existing productivity and video tools. Currently in limited early access for enterprise partners, Google Beam aims to redefine virtual meetings by bridging the gap between digital and physical presence. It’s a promising step toward more human and effective remote interactions.\"</span>,\n",
