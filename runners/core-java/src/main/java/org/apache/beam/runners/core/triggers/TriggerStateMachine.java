/**
 * {@code Trigger}s control when the elements for a specific key and window are output. As elements
 * arrive, they are put into one or more windows by a {@link Window} transform and its associated
 * {@link WindowFn}, and then passed to the associated {@code Trigger} to determine if the {@code
 * Window}s contents should be output.
 *
 * <p>See {@link org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.GroupByKey} and {@link Window} for more information
 * about how grouping with windows works.
 *
 * <p>The elements that are assigned to a window since the last time it was fired (or since the
 * window was created) are placed into the current window pane. Triggers are evaluated against the
 * elements as they are added. When the root trigger fires, the elements in the current pane will be
 * output. When the root trigger finishes (indicating it will never fire again), the window is
 * closed and any new elements assigned to that window are discarded.
 *
 * <p>Several predefined {@code Trigger}s are provided:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link AfterWatermarkStateMachine} for firing when the watermark passes a timestamp
 *     determined from either the end of the window or the arrival of the first element in a pane.
 * <li> {@link AfterProcessingTimeStateMachine} for firing after some amount of processing time has
 *     elapsed (typically since the first element in a pane).
 * <li> {@link AfterPaneStateMachine} for firing off a property of the elements in the current pane,
 *     such as the number of elements that have been assigned to the current pane.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition, {@code Trigger}s can be combined in a variety of ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link RepeatedlyStateMachine#forever} to create a trigger that executes forever. Any time
 *     its argument finishes it gets reset and starts over. Can be combined with {@link
 *     TriggerStateMachine#orFinally} to specify a condition that causes the repetition to stop.
 * <li> {@link AfterEachStateMachine#inOrder} to execute each trigger in sequence, firing each (and
 *     every) time that a trigger fires, and advancing to the next trigger in the sequence when it
 *     finishes.
 * <li> {@link AfterFirstStateMachine#of} to create a trigger that fires after at least one of its
 *     arguments fires. An {@link AfterFirstStateMachine} trigger finishes after it fires once.
 * <li> {@link AfterAllStateMachine#of} to create a trigger that fires after all least one of its
 *     arguments have fired at least once. An {@link AfterAllStateMachine} trigger finishes after it
 *     fires once.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each trigger tree is instantiated per-key and per-window. Every trigger in the tree is in one
 * of the following states:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Never Existed - before the trigger has started executing, there is no state associated with
 *     it anywhere in the system. A trigger moves to the executing state as soon as it processes in
 *     the current pane.
 * <li> Executing - while the trigger is receiving items and may fire. While it is in this state, it
 *     may persist book-keeping information to persisted state, set timers, etc.
 * <li> Finished - after a trigger finishes, all of its book-keeping data is cleaned up, and the
 *     system remembers only that it is finished. Entering this state causes us to discard any
 *     elements in the buffer for that window, as well.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Once finished, a trigger cannot return itself back to an earlier state, however a composite
 * trigger could reset its sub-triggers.
 *
 * <p>Triggers should not build up any state internally since they may be recreated between
 * invocations of the callbacks. All important values should be persisted using state before the
 * callback returns.
