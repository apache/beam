 * discussion of constraints on {@code OldDoFn}s, including their
 * serializability, lack of access to global shared mutable state,
 * requirements for failure tolerance, and benefits of optimization.
 *
 * <p>{@code OldDoFn}s can be tested in the context of a particular
 * {@code Pipeline} by running that {@code Pipeline} on sample input
 * and then checking its output.  Unit testing of a {@code OldDoFn},
 * separately from any {@code ParDo} transform or {@code Pipeline},
 * can be done via the {@link DoFnTester} harness.
 *
 * <p>{@link DoFn} (currently experimental) offers an alternative
 * mechanism for accessing {@link ProcessContext#window()} without the need
 * to implement {@link RequiresWindowAccess}.
 *
 * <p>See also {@link #processElement} for details on implementing the transformation
 * from {@code InputT} to {@code OutputT}.
