   * Flatten can be fused into any stage.
   *
   * <p>If the assumption that for each {@link PCollection}, an element is produced in that {@link
   * PCollection} via a single path through the {@link Pipeline} DAG, a Flatten can appear in each
   * stage that produces any of its input {@link PCollection PCollections}, as all of its inputs
   * will reach it via only one of those paths.
   *
   * <p>As flatten consumes multiple inputs and produces a single output, there are two cases that
   * must be considered for the inputs.
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>All of the producers of all inputs are within a single stage
   *   <li>The producers of the inputs are in two or more stages
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>If all of the producers exist within a single stage, this is identical to any other
   * transform that consumes a single input - the output PCollection is materialized based only on
   * its consumers.
   *
   * <p>If the producers exist within separate stages, there are two other considerations:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The output PCollection must be materialized in all cases (has consumers which cannot be
   *       fused into at least one of the upstream stages).
   *   <li>All of the consumers of the output PCollection can be fused into at least one of the
   *       producing stages.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>For the former case, this again is identical to a transform that produces a materialized
   * {@link PCollection}; each path to the {@link Flatten} produces elements for the input {@link
   * PCollection}, and the output is materialized and consumed by downstream transforms identically
   * to any other materialized {@link PCollection}.
   *
   * <p>For the latter, where fusion is possible into at least one of the producer stages, Flatten
   * unzipping is performed. This consists of the following steps:
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>The flatten is fused into each upstream stage
   *   <li>Each stage which contains a producer that can be fused with the output {@link
   *       PCollection} fuses that {@link PCollection}. Elements produced by that stage for the
   *       output of the flatten are never materialized.
   *   <li>Each stage which cannot be fused with the output {@link PCollection} materializes the
   *       output of the {@link Flatten}. All of the downstream consumers exist in a stage which
   *       reads from the output of that {@link Flatten}, which contains all of the elements from
   *       the stages that could not fuse with those consumers.
   * </ol>
