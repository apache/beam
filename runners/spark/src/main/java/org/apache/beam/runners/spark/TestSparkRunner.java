/**
 * The SparkRunner translate operations defined on a pipeline to a representation executable
 * by Spark, and then submitting the job to Spark to be executed. If we wanted to run a dataflow
 * pipeline with the default options of a single threaded spark instance in local mode, we would do
 * the following:
 *
 * {@code
 * Pipeline p = [logic for pipeline creation]
 * EvaluationResult result = SparkRunner.create().run(p);
 * }
 *
 * To create a pipeline runner to run against a different spark cluster, with a custom master url we
 * would do the following:
 *
 * {@code
 * Pipeline p = [logic for pipeline creation]
 * SparkPipelineOptions options = SparkPipelineOptionsFactory.create();
 * options.setSparkMaster("spark://host:port");
 * EvaluationResult result = SparkRunner.create(options).run(p);
