### Just a simple script to bootstrap the FlinkJobServerDriver
### For the environment, see the Dockerfile

# The following (forking to the background, then waiting) enables to use CTRL+C to kill the container.
# We're PID 1 which doesn't handle signals. By forking the Java process to the background,
# a PID > 1 is created which handles signals. After the command shuts down, the script and
# thus the container will also exit.

java -cp "jars/*" org.apache.beam.runners.flink.FlinkJobServerDriver "$@" &
wait
