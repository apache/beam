# Beam Playground Cloud Build Setup

This directory organizes Infrastructure-as-Code to provision dependent resources and setup Cloud Build for Beam Playground.

## Requirements:

- [GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/)
- Enabled [Cloud Build API](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis)
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
- An existing Google Cloud Storage Bucket to save Terraform state - `state_bucket`
- DNS name for your Playground deployment instance
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Apache Beam GitHub](https://github.com/apache/beam) repository cloned locally

## Usage

The folders are named according to the required order of execution. The steps below assume you are using a terminal and are in the root directory of this repository.

### 1. Setup the Google Cloud project

The `cloudbuild-manual-setup/01.setup` provisions dependencies required to setup Cloud Build for Playground:
- Required API services
- Cloud Build service account
- IAM permissions for Cloud Build service account

#### Execute the module

```console
# Create new configuration to auth to GCP Project
gcloud init

# Acquire new user credentials to use for Application Default Credentials
gcloud auth application-default login

# Navigate to cloudbuild-manual-setup/01.setup folder
cd 01.setup

# Setup Cloud Build SA
terraform init
terraform apply

```
### 2. Connect GitHub repository and Cloud Build
Follow [Connect to a GitHub repository](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/github/connect-repo-github) to connect GitHub repository and Cloud Build.

### 3. Setup the Google Cloud Build triggers

The `cloudbuild-manual-setup/02.builders` provisions:
- Cloud Build trigger to build and deploy Beam Playground.

#### Execute the module

Set required variables for GitHub repository owner, name and branch.

```
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER=<CHANGEME>
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME=<CHANGME>
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_BRANCH=<CHANGME>
```
Run the following commands to execute the module. Terraform will ask your permission before provisioning resources. If you agree with terraform provisioning resources, type `yes` to proceed.

```
# Navigate to cloudbuild-manual-setup/02.builders folder from cloudbuild-manual-setup/01.setup
cd ../02.builders
terraform init
terraform apply -var="github_repository_owner=$GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER" /
-var="github_repository_name=$GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME" -var="github_repository_branch=$GITHUB_REPOSITORY_BRANCH"
```

After completing these steps, GCP project will have 2 Cloud Build triggers that can be used to build and deploy Beam Playground.

### Run Cloud Build Triggers

**To fully deploy Playground you will have to run 2 triggers.**
