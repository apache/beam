# Playground deployment on GCP
This guide shows you how to deploy full Playground environment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment.
Alternatively, you can automate Playground environment deployment with Cloud Build as described in [readme](infrastructure/cloudbuild-manual-setup/README.md).

## Prerequisites:

### Following items need to be setup for Playground deployment on GCP:
1. [GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)

2. [GCP User account](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/access-control?tab=python) _(Note: You will find the instruction "How to create User account" for your new project)_<br>
Ensure that the account has at least the following  [IAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles):
   - App Engine Admin
   - App Engine Creator
   - Artifact Registry Administrator
   - Cloud Datastore Index Admin
   - Cloud Datastore User
   - Cloud Memorystore Redis Admin
   - Cloud Functions Developer
   - Compute Admin
   - Create Service Accounts
   - DNS Administrator
   - Kubernetes Engine Admin
   - Quota Administrator
   - Role Administrator
   - Security Admin
   - Service Account User
   - Storage Admin

3. [Google Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) for Terraform state file

4. DNS name for your Playground deployment instance further referred as <playground.zone>

5. OS with installed software listed below:

* [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
* [Kubernetes Command Line Interface](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
* [HELM](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
* [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
* [Kubectl authentication](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke)
* [GO](https://go.dev/doc/install)

6. Apache Beam Git repository cloned locally

# Prepare deployment configuration:
Playground uses `terraform.tfvars` located in `playground/terraform/environment/<environment_name>` to define variables specific to an environment (e.g., prod, test, staging).<br>
1. Create a folder (further referred as <environment_name>) to define a new environment and place configuration files into it:

* `terraform.tfvars` environment variables:
```
project_id             = "project_id"               # GCP Project ID
network_name           = "playground-network"       # GCP VPC Network Name for Playground deployment
subnetwork_name        = "playground-subnetwork"    # GCP VPC Subnetwork Name for Playground deployment
gke_name               = "playground-backend"       # Playground GKE Cluster name
region                 = "us-east1"                 # Deployment region for all created resources
zone                   = "us-east1-b"               # Deployment zone in the specified region
state_bucket           = "playground-state-bucket"  # GCS bucket name for Terraform state file. The bucket must be created manually before deployment
redis_name             = "playground-redis"         # Name for Redis instance
redis_tier             = "BASIC"                    # Redis tier type. Options: "Basic" or "Standard_HA". Default: "BASIC"
min_count              = 2                          # Min node count for the GKE cluster
max_count              = 6                          # Max node count for the GKE cluster
skip_appengine_deploy  = false                      # AppEngine flag - defined if AppEngine and Datastore need to be installed. Should be "true" if AppEngine and Datastore were installed before
ip_address_name        = "playground-static-ip"     # GCP Static IP Address name
repository_id          = "playground-artifacts"     # GCP Artifact repository name for Playground images
service_account_id     = "playground-gke-sa"   # GCP Service account name
gke_machine_type       = "e2-standard-8"            # Machine type for GKE Nodes
env                    = "prod"                     # Environment. The same value as for <environment_name> parameter

```
* `state.tfbackend` environment variables:
```
bucket               = "playground-state-bucket"         # GCS bucket name for Terraform state file. The same value as in terraform.tfvars file.
```
2. Configure authentication for the Google Cloud Platform
```
gcloud init
```
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```
# Deploy Playground infrastructure:
If you intend to install more than one environment, you may need to manually remove 'playground/terraform/.terraform' folder before a new attempt

1. Start the following command from the top level repository folder ("beam") to deploy the Payground infrastructure:
```
./gradlew playground:terraform:InitInfrastructure -Pproject_environment="<environment_name>"
```

2. Find a Static IP in your GCP project>VPC Network>IP Addresses>pg-static-ip
<br>Add following DNS A records for the discovered static IP address:
```
java.<playground.zone>
python.<playground.zone>
scio.<playground.zone>
go.<playground.zone>
router.<playground.zone>
<playground.zone>
```

[More about A records in DNS](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2579934?hl=en)

# Deploy Playground to Kubernetes:

1. Run the following command to authenticate in the Docker registry:
```
gcloud auth configure-docker <region>-docker.pkg.dev
```
2. Run the following command to authenticate in GKE:
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials --region <zone> <gke_name> --project <project_id>
```
Start the following command from the top level repository folder ("beam") to deploy the Payground infrastructure:
```
./gradlew playground:terraform:gkebackend -Pproject_environment="<environment_name>" -Pdocker-tag="tag" \
  -Pdns-name="<playground.zone>" -Psdk-tag=2.44.0 \
   -Pdocker-repository-root="<region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project_id>/<repository_id>" -Pdatastore-namespace="Playground"
```
Where tag - image tag for docker images, Psdk-tag - current Apache Beam SDK version, Pdatastore-namespace - namespace for Datastore

During script execution, a Google managed certificate will be created. [Provisioning might take up to 60 minutes](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs).

# Validate deployed Playground:
1. Run "helm list" command in the console to ensure that status is "deployed":
```
NAME            NAMESPACE  REVISION        UPDATED         STATUS          CHART                          APP VERSION
playground      default       1            your time      deployed        playground-2.44.0-SNAPSHOT         1.0.0
```
2. Run "kubectl get managedcertificate" command in the console to ensure that status is "Active":
```
NAME               AGE     STATUS
GCP Project       time     Active
```
3. Open Beam Playground frontend webpage in a web browser (e.g. https://playground.zone) to ensure that Playground frontend page is available
