# Requirements

The following items need to be setup for the Playground cluster deployment on GCP:

* [GCP account](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [`gcloud` command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) and required setup i.e. login
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) tool
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

# Deployment steps

## 0. Create GCS bucket for state

```bash
$ gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} gs://state-bucket-name
$ gsutil versioning set on gs://state-bucket-name
```

## 1. Create new environment

To provide information about the terraform backend, run the following commands

* New environment folder

```bash
mkdir /path/to/beam/playground/terraform/environment/{env-name}
```

* Backend config

```bash
echo 'bucket = "put your state bucket name here"' > /path/to/beam/playground/terraform/environment/{env-name}/state.tfbackend
```

* Terraform variables config and provide necessary variables

```bash
touch /path/to/beam/playground/terraform/environment/{env-name}/terraform.tfvars
```

Then provide necessary variables.

## 2. Provision infrastructure

To deploy Playground infrastructure run gradle task:

```bash
./gradlew playground:terraform:InitInfrastructure -Pproject_environment="env-name"
```

## 3. Deploy application

To deploy application run following steps:

* Authinticate in Artifact registry

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

* Ð’eploy backend services

```bash
./gradlew playground:terraform:deployBackend -Pproject_environment="env-name" -Pdocker-tag="tag"
```

* Deploy frontend service

```bash
./gradlew playground:terraform:deployFrontend -Pproject_environment="env-name" -Pdocker-tag="tag" ```
