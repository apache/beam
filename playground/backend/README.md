# Apache Beam Playground

## About

Apache Beam is an open-source, unified model for defining parallel processing pipelines for batch and streaming data.
It provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed
across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.

Beam Playground helps facilitate trying out and adopting Apache Beam by providing a very quick way for prospective Beam
users to see and run examples of Apache Beam pipelines in a web interface that requires no setup.

## Getting Started

See [playground/README.md](../README.md) for details on requirements and setup.

This section describes what is needed to run the backend application.
- Generating models from proto file
- Go commands to run/test application locally

### Go commands to run/test application locally

The following command is used to build and serve the backend locally:

```
go run ./cmd/server/server.go
```

Run the following command to generate a release build file:

```
go build ./cmd/server/server.go
```

Playground tests may be run using this command:

```
go test ... -v
```

The full list of commands can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go).

## Running the server app

To run the server using Docker images there are `Docker` files in the `containers` folder for Go and Java languages.
Each of them processes the corresponding SDK, so the backend with Go SDK will work with Go examples/katas/tests only.

One more way to run the server is to run it locally how it is described above.

## Calling the server from another client

To call the server from another client â€“ models and client code should be generated using the
`playground/api/v1/api.proto` file. More information about generating models and client's code using `.proto`
files for each language can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).

## Deployment
