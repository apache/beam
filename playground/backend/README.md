# Apache Beam Playground

## About

Apache Beam is an open-source, unified model for defining parallel processing pipelines for batch and streaming data.
It provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed
across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.

Beam Playground helps facilitate trying out and adopting Apache Beam by providing a very quick way for prospective Beam
users to see and run examples of Apache Beam pipelines in a web interface that requires no setup.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed (1.16 version).
- [Protocol Buffer Compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

## Getting Started

This section describes what is needed to run the backend application.
- Generating models from proto file
- Go commands to run/test application locally

### Generating models from proto file

Beam Playground uses gRPC for communication between client and server. For using gRPC there is a
`playground/proto/playground.proto` file which contains the definition of all models. To use models in the code they
should be generated firstly using the `playground/proto/playground.proto` file.

Run the following command from `/playground` directory:

```
protoc --go_out=backend/pkg/api --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
--go-grpc_out=backend/pkg/api --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative --proto_path=playground/v1 \
playground.proto
```

As a result you will receive 2 files into `backend/pkg/api` folder with models (`playground.pb.go`) and client/server
structures (`playground_grpc.pb.go`).
More information about using gRPC you can find [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).

### Go commands to run/test application locally

The following command is used to build and serve the backend locally:

```
go run ./cmd/server/server.go
```

Run the following command to generate a release build file:

```
go build ./cmd/server/server.go
```

Playground tests may be run using this command:

```
go test ./test/... -v
```

The full list of commands can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go).

## Running the server app

To run the server using Docker images there are `Docker` files in the `containers` folder for Go and Java languages.
Each of them processes the corresponding SDK, so the backend with Go SDK will work with Go examples/katas/tests only.

One more way to run the server is to run it locally how it is described above.

## Calling the server from another client

To call the server from another client â€“ models and client code should be generated using the
`playground/playground/v1/playground.proto` file. More information about generating models and client's code using `.proto`
files for each language can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).
