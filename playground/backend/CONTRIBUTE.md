## Generated Files

All generated files (generated grpc API files, `go.sum`) should be published to the repository.

## Code processing pipeline

### Controller’s work

1. Backend receives a request for the `RunCode` API method
2. Backend checks that the SDK from the request matches the backend’s environment.
3. Backend generates the key of the code processing (`uuid` format), saves it to the cache, and sends it back to the
   client.
4. Backend starts a new goroutine that processes the code from the client request.

### Code processing goroutine

1. Backend sets up a timeout for each code processing.
2. Backend starts a new goroutine to check that current code processing is still actual and hasn’t been canceled by the
   client.
3. Validation of the received code.
4. Preparing the received code.
5. Compilation of the received code.
6. Execution of the received code.

Each step (`3-6` steps) is a separate goroutine and could be stopped if code processing has been canceled, or it takes
too much time.

After each step (even if it ends with failure) status of the code processing changes according to a finished step, so
the client clearly understands what is happening with the code processing at the moment.

Status, all outputs, and all error messages are placed to the one common cache, so even if there are several instances
it does not matter which instance process the code.

## How to add a new supported language

1. Add the language to [api.proto](../api/v1/api.proto) file:

```
enum Sdk {
  SDK_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  SDK_JAVA = 1;
  SDK_GO = 2;
  SDK_PYTHON = 3;
  SDK_SCIO = 4;
}
```

2. Create a new environment for a new language as [this one](containers/java)
3. Create a new config file for a new language as [this one](configs/SDK_JAVA.json)
4. Update a method to create file system according to a new language [here](internal/fs_tool/fs.go) (`NewLifeCycle()`
   method)
5. Update a method to set up a file system according to a new
   language [here](internal/setup_tools/life_cycle/life_cycle_setuper.go) (`Setup()` method)
6. Update a method to set up code validator according to a new language[here](internal/utils/validators_utils.go)
7. Update a method to set up code preparers according to a new language [here](internal/utils/preparators_utils.go)
8. Update a method to set up compiler according to a new
   language [here](internal/setup_tools/builder/setup_builder.go) (`Compiler()` method)
9. Update a method to set up runner according to a new
   language [here](internal/setup_tools/builder/setup_builder.go) (`Runner()` method)
10. Update a method to set up test runner according to a new
    language [here](internal/setup_tools/builder/setup_builder.go) (`TestRunner()` method)
11. Update a method to compile client's code according to a new
    language [here](internal/code_processing/code_processing.go) (`compileStep()` method)
12. Update a method to execute client's code according to a new
    language [here](internal/code_processing/code_processing.go) (`runStep()` method)
