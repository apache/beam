# Setup development prerequisites
> ***Google Cloud Shell note***: Google Cloud Shell already has most of the prerequisites installed. Only the following has to be installed manually:
> - Flutter - run `flutter precache`
> - Go protobuf dependencies
> - Dart protobuf dependencies
> - buf
> - sbt

1. Install Go 1.18+

    > Do not forget to update your `PATH` environment variable
1. Install Dart protobuf dependencies: [Dart gRPC Quickstart](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/dart/quickstart/)
    > Do not forget to update your `PATH` environment variable
1. Install npm
    **Ubuntu 22.04 and newer/Debian 11 and newer:**
    ```shell
    sudo apt install npm
    ```
    **Other Linux variants:** Follow manual at https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

    ```shell
    sudo apt install docker.io
    ```
    **Other Linux variants:** Follow manual at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

    To verify your docker installation, run:
    ```shell
    docker ps
    ```
    It should finish without any errors. If you get a permission denied error, you need to add your user to the docker group:
    ```shell
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
    Then, log out and log back in to apply the changes.
1. Install Docker Compose

    ```shell
    sudo apt install docker-compose
    ```
    **Other Linux variants:** Follow manual at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
1. Install gcloud CLI by following the [manual](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) for your system
1. Install Cloud Datastore Emulator
    ```shell
    gcloud components install cloud-datastore-emulator
    ```
    or, if you have install gcloud CLI using APT:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install google-cloud-cli-datastore-emulator
    ```
1. Install `sbt` following instruction at https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html
    > **Optional**: Run `sbt` comamnd once after installation to let it cache its dependencies
1. Make sure that you have the full installation of Python 3.8 or newer. On Debian or Ubuntu it can be installed using `sudo apt install python3-full`.

# Common tasks
To get an overview of common tasks, see [TASKS.md](TASKS.md)

# Run Beam Playground locally
## Configure frontend to use local backend
> **Note:** Follow this step only if you want to have a local deployment of Playground. Skip this step entirely if you want to deploy Playground to Google Cloud.

Uncommend lines after `// Uncomment the following lines to use local backend.` in [frontend/playground_components/lib/src/constants/backend_urls.dart](/playground/frontend/playground_components/lib/src/constants/backend_urls.dart)

## Run local deployment using Gradle task
> For more information read the corresponding section in [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md#router-runners-and-frontend)

Run the deployment script:
```shell
./gradlew :playground:dockerComposeLocalUp
```

To shut down the playground, run:
```shell
./gradlew :playground:dockerComposeLocalDown
```

## Deploy examples
1. Go to `/playground/infrastucture` directory
    ```shell
    cd playground/infrastucture
    ```
1. Setup python venv
    ```shell
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
1. Activate venv
    ```shell
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
1. Install dependencies
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. Setup the environment variables
    ```shell
    export BEAM_ROOT_DIR=$(realpath ../../)
    export SDK_CONFIG="../../playground/sdks.yaml"
    export BEAM_EXAMPLE_CATEGORIES="../categories.yaml"
    export BEAM_USE_WEBGRPC=yes
    export BEAM_CONCURRENCY=4
    export DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8081
    ```

1. Run the `ci_cd.py` script

    ```shell
    export SERVER_ADDRESS=<runner_address> # see the note below
    python ci_cd.py --step CD \
                    --sdk <SDK> \ # SDK_GO, SDK_JAVA, SDK_PYTHON, SDK_SCIO
                    --namespace Playground \
                    --datastore-project test \
                    --origin PG_EXAMPLES \
                    --subdirs $BEAM_ROOT_DIR/sdks $BEAM_ROOT_DIR/examples $BEAM_ROOT_DIR/learning/katas # For SCIO examples see note below
    ```
    > **Note:** The `SERVER_ADDRESS` variable should be set to the address of the runner server for the particular SDK. For the local deployment the default values are:
    > | SDK | Address |
    > | --- | --- |
    > | Go | `localhost:8084` |
    > | Java | `localhost:8086` |
    > | Python | `localhost:8088` |
    > | SCIO | `localhost:8090` |

    > **Note:** SCIO examples are not committed to the Beam tree. You will need to use [`fetch_scala_examples.py`](infrastructure/fetch_scala_examples.py) script to download them to some directory and then use `--subdirs` option to point to that directory. For example:
    > ```shell
    > python fetch_scala_examples.py --output-dir /tmp/scio-examples
    > python ci_cd.py --step CD \
    >                 --sdk SDK_SCIO \
    >                 --namespace Playground \
    >                 --datastore-project test \
    >                 --origin PG_EXAMPLES \
    >                 --subdirs /tmp/scio-examples
    > ```
    > See [this section](TASKS.md##obtaining-scio-examples) for more information.
