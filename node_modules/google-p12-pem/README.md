## Quickstart

### Installing the client library

```bash
npm install google-p12-pem
```


### Using the client library

```javascript
const {getPem} = require('google-p12-pem');

/**
 * Given a p12 file, convert it to the PEM format.
 * @param {string} pathToCert The relative path to a p12 file.
 */
async function quickstart() {
  // TODO(developer): provide the path to your cert
  // const pathToCert = 'path/to/cert.p12';

  const pem = await getPem(pathToCert);
  console.log('The converted PEM:');
  console.log(pem);
}

quickstart();

```
#### CLI style

``` sh
gp12-pem myfile.p12 > output.pem
```


## Samples

Samples are in the [`samples/`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-p12-pem/tree/main/samples) directory. Each sample's `README.md` has instructions for running its sample.

| Sample                      | Source Code                       | Try it |

also contains samples.

## Supported Node.js Versions

Our client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
Libraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of
Node.js.
If you are using an end-of-life version of Node.js, we recommend that you update
as soon as possible to an actively supported LTS version.

Google's client libraries support legacy versions of Node.js runtimes on a
best-efforts basis with the following warnings:

* Legacy versions are not tested in continuous integration.
* Some security patches and features cannot be backported.
* Dependencies cannot be kept up-to-date.

Client libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and
can be installed through npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).
The dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.
For example, `npm install google-p12-pem@legacy-8` installs client libraries
for versions compatible with Node.js 8.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


This library is considered to be **General Availability (GA)**. This means it
is stable; the code surface will not change in backwards-incompatible ways
unless absolutely necessary (e.g. because of critical security issues) or with
an extensive deprecation period. Issues and requests against **GA** libraries
are addressed with the highest priority.
