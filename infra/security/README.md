# GCP Security Analyzer

This document describes the implementation of a security analyzer for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources. The analyzer is designed to enhance security monitoring within our GCP environment by capturing critical events and generating alerts for specific security-sensitive actions.

## How It Works

1.  **Log Sinks**: The system uses [GCP Log Sinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2) to capture specific security-related log entries. These sinks are configured to filter for events like IAM policy changes or service account key creation.
2.  **Log Storage**: The filtered logs are routed to a dedicated Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket for persistence and analysis.
3.  **Report Generation**: A scheduled job runs weekly, executing the `log_analyzer.py` script.
4.  **Email Alerts**: The script analyzes the logs from the past week, compiles a summary of security events, and sends a report to a configured email address.

## Configuration

The behavior of the log analyzer is controlled by a `config.yml` file. Hereâ€™s an overview of the configuration options:

-   `project_id`: The GCP project ID where the resources are located.
-   `bucket_name`: The name of the GCS bucket where logs will be stored.
-   `logging`: Configures the logging level and format for the script.
-   `sinks`: A list of log sinks to be created. Each sink has the following properties:
    -   `name`: A unique name for the sink.
    -   `description`: A brief description of what the sink monitors.
    -   `filter_methods`: A list of GCP API methods to include in the filter (e.g., `SetIamPolicy`).
    -   `excluded_principals`: A list of service accounts or user emails to exclude from monitoring, such as CI/CD service accounts.

### Example Configuration (`config.yml`)

```yaml
project_id: your-gcp-project-id
bucket_name: your-log-storage-bucket

sinks:
  - name: iam-policy-changes
    description: Monitors changes to IAM policies.
    filter_methods:
      - "SetIamPolicy"
    excluded_principals:
      - "ci-cd-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

## Usage

The `log_analyzer.py` script provides two main commands for managing the security analyzer.

### Initializing Sinks

To create or update the log sinks in GCP based on your `config.yml` file, run the following command:

```bash
python log_analyzer.py --config config.yml initialize
```

This command ensures that the log sinks are correctly configured to capture the desired security events.

### Generating Weekly Reports

To generate and send the weekly security report, run this command:

```bash
python log_analyzer.py --config config.yml generate-report
```

This is typically run as a scheduled job (GitHub Action) to automate the delivery of weekly security reports.
