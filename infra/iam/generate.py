# THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO RUN AFTER THE MIGRATION.
# This script is used to export the IAM policy of a Google Cloud project to a YAML format.
# It retrieves the IAM policy bindings, parses the members, and formats the output in a structured
# YAML format, excluding service accounts and groups. The output includes usernames, emails, and
# their associated permissions, with optional conditions for roles that have conditions attached.
# You need to have the Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated to run this script.
