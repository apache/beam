# Apache Beam communication strategy - DRAFT

Before we design a communicatoion strategy, I wanted to map out the existing channels and content. 
This is a diagram that shows channels and what type of content goes there:

## Questions for the community:
1. Am I missing any channels?
1. Is there any other type of content that should go on the map?
1. Do you have any questions, or do you think the graphic could have more clarifications?
