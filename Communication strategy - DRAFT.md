1. Is there any other type of content that should go on the map? [Click here to add comments](https://github.com/macruzbar/beam/issues/2)
1. Do you have any questions, or do you think the graphic could have more clarifications? [Click here to add comments](https://github.com/macruzbar/beam/issues/3)

## Next steps:
* Proposed changes to content map
* Communications plan that optimizes content creation.
