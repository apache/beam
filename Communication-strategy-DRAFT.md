# Apache Beam communication strategy - DRAFT


## Step 1: Map out the existing channels and content. 
This is the first version of a diagram that shows channels and what type of content goes there:

This graphic was submitted for community review, with the following questions for the community:
1. Are there any channels missing? [Click here to add comments](https://github.com/macruzbar/beam/issues/1)
1. Is there any other type of content that should go on the map? [Click here to add comments](https://github.com/macruzbar/beam/issues/2)
1. Do you have any questions, or do you think the graphic could have more clarifications? [Click here to add comments](https://github.com/macruzbar/beam/issues/3)

With the feedback received over email and on the issues, this is the revised diagram:

## Step 2: Create the Apache Beam communications logic model 
A [logic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_model) is a hypothesized description of the chain of causes and effects leading to an outcome of interest. Here, you can see how the channels mapped on step 1 (now at the bottom) work towards project goals.

If you have any questions or comments about this logic model, please add them [here](https://github.com/macruzbar/beam/issues/4). 

## Step 3: Describe communications strategy
In this section, we are going to describe what areas to focus on and how to use content in a more strategic way. 
Due: December 17.
