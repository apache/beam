## Contributing to Beam

*Before opening a pull request*, review the 
[Beam contribution guide](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/). 
It lists steps that are required before creating a PR. In particular, consider

- Have you searched for existing, related JIRAs and pull requests?
- Have you shared your intent by creating an issue in JIRA and self-assigned?
- If the change is large, have you discussed it on the dev@ mailing list?
- Is the change being proposed clearly explained and motivated?
