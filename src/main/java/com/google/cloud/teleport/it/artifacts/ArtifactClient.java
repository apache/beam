/**
 * Interface for working with test artifacts.
 *
 * <p>It is the responsibility of implementations to make sure that artifacts are kept separate from
 * each other. Using a GCS path, this isolation would create a path like the following: {@code
 * gs://test-class-name/run-id/test-method-name}. Each directory means:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>test-class-name: A name given to the directory for a test class. This does not need to be
 *       identical to the class name, but it should clearly identify the class from other test
 *       classes. This is intended for long-lived artifacts that have value beyond a specific run of
 *       a test, such as a result file.
 *   <li>run-id: An id assigned to a run of that test class. This will be handled by implementations
 *       of this client. It is intended for artifacts that may be referenced by multiple methods in
 *       a test class.
 *   <li>test-method-name: A name given to the directory for a method within the test class. This
 *       does not need to be identical to the method name, but it should clearly identify the method
 *       from other test methods within the same test class. This is intended for input and output
 *       artifacts specific to the test method.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Separate input/output directories are optional and the responsibility of the test writer to
 * maintain.
