  Deciding to release and selecting a Release Manager is the first step of
  the release process. This is a consensus-based decision of the entire
  community. Anybody can propose a release on the dev@ mailing list, giving
  a solid argument and nominating a committer as the Release Manager
  (including themselves). Thereâ€™s no formal process, no vote requirements,
  and no timing requirements. Any objections should be resolved by consensus
  before starting the release."
