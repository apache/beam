# License Compliance in Apache Beam

## Overview
Every source file in Apache Beam **MUST** include the Apache 2.0 license header. The RAT (Release Audit Tool) check will fail if any file is missing the required license.

## License Headers by File Type

## RAT Check

### Running Locally
```bash
./gradlew rat
```

### Checking Results
If the RAT check fails, view the report:
```
build/reports/rat/index.html
```

## Key Rules

1. **Every new file needs a license header** - No exceptions for source files
2. **Place header at the very top** - Before any code, imports, or declarations
3. **Use correct comment style** - Match the file type's comment syntax
4. **YAML frontmatter exception** - For files with YAML frontmatter (like SKILL.md), place the license as YAML comments inside the frontmatter block, after the opening `---`
5. **Dependencies must be Apache-compatible** - New dependencies need licenses compatible with Apache 2.0

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting to add headers to new test files
- Missing headers on configuration files (.yaml, .json, .xml)
- Adding HTML comments before YAML frontmatter (breaks parsing)
