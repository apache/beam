# Docker containers

The Beam [portability effort](https://s.apache.org/beam-fn-api) aims to make it possible
for any SDK to work with any runner. One aspect of the effort is the isolation of the SDK
and user code execution environment from the runner execution environment using
[docker](https://www.docker.com/), as defined in the portability
[container contract](https://s.apache.org/beam-fn-api-container-contract).

This document describes how to build and push container images to that end. The push
step generally requires an account with a public docker registry, such
as [bintray.io](bintray.io) or
[Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry). These
instructions assume familiarity with docker and a bintray account under the
current username with a docker repository named "apache".

## How to build container images

**Prerequisites**: install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your
platform. You can verify that it works by running `docker images` or any other
docker command.

Run Gradle with the `docker` target:

```
$ pwd
[...]/beam
$ ./gradlew docker
[...]

```

Note that the container images include built content, including the Go boot
code. Some images, notably python, take a while to build, so building just
the specific images needed can be a lot faster:

```
$ ./gradlew :sdks:java:container:docker
$ ./gradlew :sdks:python:container:docker
$ ./gradlew :sdks:go:containers:docker
```

**(Optional)** When built, you can see, inspect and run them locally:

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                       TAG                    IMAGE ID            CREATED       SIZE
herohde-docker-apache.bintray.io/beam/python     latest             4ea515403a1a      3 minutes ago     1.27GB
herohde-docker-apache.bintray.io/beam/java       latest             0103512f1d8f     34 minutes ago      780MB
herohde-docker-apache.bintray.io/beam/go         latest             ce055985808a     35 minutes ago      121MB
[...]
```

Despite the names, these container images live only on your local machine.
While we will re-use the same tag "latest" for each build, the
images IDs will change.

**(Optional)**: the default setting for `docker-repository-root` specifies the above bintray
location. You can override it by adding: 

```
-Pdocker-repository-root=<location>
```

Similarly, if you want to specify a specific tag instead of "latest", such as a "2.3.0"
version, you can do so by adding:

```
-Pdocker-tag=<tag>
```

## How to push container images

**Preprequisites**: obtain a docker registry account and ensure docker can push images to it,
usually by doing `docker login` with the appropriate information. The image you want
to push must also be present in the local docker image repository.

For the Python SDK harness container image, run:

```
$ docker push $USER-docker-apache.bintray.io/beam/python:latest
The push refers to repository [herohde-docker-apache.bintray.io/beam/python]

```

Similarly for the Java and Go SDK harness container images. If you want to push the same image
to multiple registries, you can retag the image using `docker tag` and push.

**(Optional)** On any machine, you can now pull the pushed container image:

```
$ docker pull $USER-docker-apache.bintray.io/beam/python:latest
latest: Pulling from beam/python

Note that the image IDs and digests match their local counterparts.
