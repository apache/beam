# This script will be run by Jenkins as a post commit test. In order to run
# locally make the following changes:
#
# GCS_LOCATION -> Temporary location to use for service tests.
# PROJECT      -> Project name to use for dataflow and docker images.
# REGION       -> Region name to use for Dataflow
#
# Execute from the root of the repository:
#     test Python3.8 x86 container:
#         ./gradlew :sdks:python:test-suites:dataflow:py38:validatesContainer
#     or test all supported python versions x86 containers together:
#         ./gradlew :sdks:python:test-suites:dataflow:validatesContainer
#
# Note: ARM test suites only run on github actions. For example, to test Python3.8 ARM containers,
# commenting `Run Python ValidatesContainer Dataflow ARM (3.8)` will trigger the test.
