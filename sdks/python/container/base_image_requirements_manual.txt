# This file has additional packages to install in Beam's containers.
# Do not specify dependencies, which are already in Beam's setup.py.
# See generate_pip_requirements_list.sh to find which extras (e.g. gcp) are used.
# Do not specify a constrained version without a particular reason, so that
# we can pick up recent versions when regenerating the requirements.
# Consider constraining requirements of Beam itself when necessary.

bs4  # Commonly used HTML processing tool.
# Don't upgrade to Cython 3.x, until it's released, stable and we have consensus
# to upgrade. Use 0.xx for now.

# Leaving 'future' in our containers for now prevent breaking tft users.
