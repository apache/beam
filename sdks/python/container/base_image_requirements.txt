# These are packages needed by the Apache Beam Python SDK. Their versions need to be compatible with
# the requirements in sdks/python/setup.py. Specifying the versions manually helps to resolve
# dependency conflicts with other packages installed in the container.
# Additional SDK dependencies not listed here will be installed when SDK is installed when creating
# the container.
