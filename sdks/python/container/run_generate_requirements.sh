# Generates requirements files, which list PyPI depenedncies to install in
# Apache Beam Python SDK container images. To generate the list,
# we use two sources of information:
# 1) Requirements of Apache Beam itself, as defined by setup.py.
# 2) A list of dependencies from base_image_requirements_manual.txt, which we
# maintain manually.

# It is recommended to run this script via gralde commands such as:
# ./gradlew :sdks:python:container:generatePythonRequirementsAll
# ./gradlew :sdks:python:container:py38:generatePythonRequirements

# You will need Python intepreters for all versions supported by Beam, see:
# https://s.apache.org/beam-python-dev-wiki
