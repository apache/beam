# Exclude some unit tests because they define command line options.  Nose runs
# tests by loading the corresponding modules in the same process and the
# side-effect of defining command line options makes other tests fail.
# TODO(silviuc): Find a way to run the remaining tests excluded here.
# The following tests are excluded because they try to load the Cython-based
# fast_coders module which is not available when running unit tests:
# fast_coders_test, typecoders_test, workitem_test, and executor_test.
