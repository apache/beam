# Fraud Detection MLOps - Feature Engineering and Model Evaluation

This example demonstrates a Fraud Detection MLOps solution that uses Apache Beam
YAML SDK for feature engineering and model evaluation to detect transaction
frauds.

The entire workflow is self-contained in the
[fraud_detection_mlops_beam_yaml_sdk](./fraud_detection_mlops_beam_yaml_sdk.ipynb)
notebook.
