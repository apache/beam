  # Step 1: Creating a collection of elements that needs
  # to be enriched. Here we are simulating sales data
    - type: Create
      config:
        elements:
        - sale_id: 1
          customer_id: 1
          product_id: 1
          quantity: 1

  # Step 2: Enriching the data with Bigtable
  # This specific bigtable stores product data in the below format
  # product:product_id, product:product_name, product:product_stock
    - type: Enrichment
      config:
        enrichment_handler: 'BigTable'

  # Step 3: Logging for testing
  # This is a simple way to view the enriched data
  # We can also store it somewhere like a json file
