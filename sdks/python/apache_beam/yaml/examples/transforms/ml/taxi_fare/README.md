## Streaming Taxi Fare Prediction Pipeline

The example leverages the `RunInference` transform with Vertex AI
model handler [VertexAIModelHandlerJSON](
https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.yaml.yaml_ml#apache_beam.yaml.yaml_ml.VertexAIModelHandlerJSONProvider),
in addition to PubSub, Kafka and BiqQuery IO to demonstrate an end-to-end
example of a streaming ML pipeline predicting NYC taxi fare amounts.

The data stream of NYC taxi ride events are from the existing public
PubSub topic `projects/pubsub-public-data/topics/taxirides-realtime`.

For setting up Kafka, an option is to use [Click to Deploy](
https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/kafka?)
to quickly launch a Kafka cluster on GCE. See [existing example here](
../../../README.md#kafka) for more context around using Kafka with Beam
and Dataflow.

BigQuery is the pipeline's sink for the inference result output.
A BigQuery dataset needs to exist first before the pipeline can
create/write to a table. Run the following command to create
a BigQuery dataset:

```sh
bq --location=us-central1 mk \
  --dataset DATASET_ID
```
See also [here](
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets) for more details on
how to create BigQuery datasets.

A trained model hosted on Vertex AI is needed before being able to use
the Vertex AI model handler. To train and deploy a custom model for the
taxi fare prediction problem, open and run this [notebook](
custom_nyc_taxifare_model_deployment.ipynb) in Colab Enterprise.

The pipeline first reads the data stream of taxi rides events from the
public PubSub topic and performs some transformations before writing it
to a Kafka topic. The pipeline then reads from that Kafka topic and applies
the necessary transformation logic, before `RunInference` transform performs
remote inference with the Vertex AI model handler and the custom-trained
model deployed to a Vertex AI endpoint. The inference result is then
parsed and written to a BigQuery table.

Run the pipeline (replace with appropriate variables in the command below):

```sh
export PROJECT="$(gcloud config get-value project)"
export TEMP_LOCATION="gs://YOUR-BUCKET/tmp"
export REGION="us-central1"
export JOB_NAME="streaming-taxifare-prediction`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`"
export NUM_WORKERS="3"

python -m apache_beam.yaml.main \
  --yaml_pipeline_file transforms/ml/taxi_fare/streaming_taxifare_prediction.yaml \
  --runner DataflowRunner \
  --temp_location $TEMP_LOCATION \
  --project $PROJECT \
  --region $REGION \
  --num_workers $NUM_WORKERS \
  --job_name $JOB_NAME \
  --jinja_variables '{ "BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS": "BOOTSTRAP_IP_ADD:9092",
  "TOPIC": "YOUR_TOPIC", "USERNAME": "KAFKA_USERNAME", "PASSWORD": "KAFKA_PASSWORD",
  "ENDPOINT": "ENDPOINT_ID", "PROJECT": "PROJECT_ID", "LOCATION": "LOCATION",
  "DATASET": "DATASET_ID", "TABLE": "TABLE_ID" }'
```
