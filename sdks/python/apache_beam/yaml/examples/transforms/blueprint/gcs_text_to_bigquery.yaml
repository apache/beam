# This is an example of a Beam YAML pipeline that reads from spanner database
# and writes to GCS avro files.  This matches the Dataflow Template located
# here - https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/templates/provided/cloud-spanner-to-avro

pipeline:
  type: chain
  transforms:
    # Step 1: Reading data from GCS
    - type: ReadFromText
      name: ReadFromGCS
      config:
        path: gs://dataflow-samples/shakespeare/kinglear.txt
    # Step 2: Write records out to BigQuery
    - type: WriteToBigQuery
      name: WriteWords
      config:
        table: "apache-beam-testing.yaml_test.words"
        create_disposition: "CREATE_NEVER"
        write_disposition: "WRITE_APPEND"
        num_streams: 1


# Expected:
#  Row(line='Fool\tThou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst')
#  Row(line='\tbeen wise.')
#  Row(line='KING LEAR\tNothing will come of nothing: speak again.')
#  Row(line='\tNever, never, never, never, never!')
