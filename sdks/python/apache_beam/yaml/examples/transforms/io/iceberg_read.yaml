# The pipeline reads from Iceberg table 'db.users.NY' on GCS with Hadoop catalog
# configured. The table, if not exists already, can be created and populated
# using the iceberg_write.yaml pipeline.
#
# Replace 'gs://MY-WAREHOUSE' with the correct GCS bucket name.
# If this example is run locally then replace '/path/to/service/account/key.json'
# with the correct path to your service account key .json file on your machine.
# Otherwise, if Dataflow runner is used then omit the 'config_properties' field.
