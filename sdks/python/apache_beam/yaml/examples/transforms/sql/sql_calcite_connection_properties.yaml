# This example demonstrates using calcite_connection_properties to enable
# dialect-specific SQL functions. By setting "fun" to "postgresql", you can
# use PostgreSQL-specific functions like STRING_TO_ARRAY in your SQL queries.
#
# The calcite_connection_properties option is passed to the underlying Calcite
# SQL engine to configure its behavior. Common properties include:
#   - "fun": SQL function library to use ("standard", "postgresql", "bigquery", etc.)
#   - "lex": Lexical policy for identifiers
#
# See Apache Calcite documentation for all available connection properties.
