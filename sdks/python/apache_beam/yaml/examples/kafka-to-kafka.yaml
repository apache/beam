# Description:
# This Apache Beam YAML pipeline demonstrates a basic Kafka-to-Kafka mirroring example.
# It reads raw byte messages from a source Kafka topic and writes them to a target Kafka topic.
# No transformation or decoding is applied.
# Useful for validating Kafka I/O setup using Beam YAML DSL.
