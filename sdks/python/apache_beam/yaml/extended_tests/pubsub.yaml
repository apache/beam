# TODO: Current PubSubIO doesn't have a max_read_time_seconds parameter like 
# Kafka does.  Without it, the ReadFromPubSub will run forever.  This is not a
# trival change. For now, we will live with the mocked tests located
# [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/bea04446b41c86856c24d0a9761622092ed9936f/sdks/python/apache_beam/yaml/yaml_io_test.py#L83).
