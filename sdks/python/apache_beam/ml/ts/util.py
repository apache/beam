class ImpulseStreamGenDoFn(beam.DoFn):
  """
  Generates a periodic, unbounded stream of elements from a provided sequence.

  (Similar to ImpulseSeqGenDoFn in apache_beam.transforms.periodicsequence)

  This Splittable DoFn (SDF) is designed to simulate a continuous stream of
  data for testing or demonstration purposes. It takes a Python sequence (e.g.,
  a list) and emits its elements one by one in a loop, assigning a timestamp
  to each.

  The DoFn operates in two modes based on the structure of the input `data`:

    - **Non-Timestamped Data**: If `data` is a sequence of arbitrary values
      (e.g., `[v1, v2, ...]`), the DoFn will assign a new timestamp to each
      emitted element. The timestamps are calculated by starting at a given
      `start_time` and incrementing by a fixed `interval`.
    - **Pre-Timestamped Data**: If `data` is a sequence of tuples, where each
      tuple is `(apache_beam.utils.timestamp.Timestamp, value)`, the DoFn
      will use the provided timestamp for the emitted element.

  The rate of emission is controlled by wall-clock time. The DoFn will only
  emit elements whose timestamp (either calculated or provided) is in the past
  compared to the current system time. When it "catches up" to the present,
  it will pause and defer the remainder of the work.

  Args:
    data: The sequence of elements to emit into the PCollection. The elements
      can be raw values or pre-timestamped tuples in the format
      `(apache_beam.utils.timestamp.Timestamp, value)`.

class PeriodicStream(beam.PTransform):
  """A PTransform that generates a periodic stream of elements from a sequence.

  This transform creates a `PCollection` by emitting elements from a provided
  Python sequence at a specified time interval. It is designed for use in
  streaming pipelines to simulate a live, continuous source of data.

  The transform can be configured to:
  - Emit the sequence only once.
  - Repeat the sequence indefinitely or for a maximum duration.
  - Control the time interval between elements.

  To ensure that the stream does not emit a burst of elements immediately at
  pipeline startup, a fixed warmup period is added before the first element
  is generated.

  Args:
      data: The sequence of elements to emit into the PCollection. The elements
        can be raw values or pre-timestamped tuples in the format
        `(apache_beam.utils.timestamp.Timestamp, value)`.
      max_duration: The maximum total duration in seconds for the stream
        generation. If `None` (the default) and `repeat` is `True`, the
        stream is effectively infinite. If `repeat` is `False`, the stream's
        duration is the shorter of this value and the time required to emit
        the sequence once.
      interval: The delay in seconds between consecutive elements.
        Defaults to 0.1.
      repeat: If `True`, the input `data` sequence is emitted repeatedly.
        If `False` (the default), the sequence is emitted only once.
