"""Windowing concepts.

A WindowInto transform logically divides up or groups the elements of a
PCollection into finite windows according to a windowing function (derived from
WindowFn).

The output of WindowInto contains the same elements as input, but they have been
logically assigned to windows. The next GroupByKey(s) transforms, including one
within a composite transform, will group by the combination of keys and windows.

Windowing a PCollection allows chunks of it to be processed individually, before
the entire PCollection is available.  This is especially important for
PCollection(s) with unbounded size, since the full PCollection is never
available at once, since more data is continually arriving. For PCollection(s)
with a bounded size (aka. conventional batch mode), by default, all data is
implicitly in a single window (see GlobalWindows), unless WindowInto is
applied.

For example, a simple form of windowing divides up the data into fixed-width
time intervals, using FixedWindows.

Seconds are used as the time unit for the built-in windowing primitives here.
Integer or floating point seconds can be passed to these primitives.

Internally, seconds, with microsecond granularity, are stored as
timeutil.Timestamp and timeutil.Duration objects. This is done to avoid
precision errors that would occur with floating point representations.

Custom windowing function classes can be created, by subclassing from
WindowFn.
