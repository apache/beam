  other work on that key.  In addition runners are optimized for latencies less

        worker for this dofn.  By default this is set to 1 as the most common
        case for async dofns are heavy CPU or GPU dofns where the dofn requires
        the a signficant fraction of the CPU/GPU.
      callback_frequency: The frequency with which the runner will check for
        elements to commit.  A short callback frequency will mean items are
        commited shortly after processing but cause additional work for the
        worker.  A large callback frequency will result in slower commits but
        less busy work.  The default of 5s will result in a maximum added
        latency of 5s while requiring relatively few resources.  If your
        messages take significantly longer than 5s to process it is recommended
        to raise this.
      max_items_to_buffer: We should ideally buffer enough to always be busy but
        not so much that the worker ooms.  By default will be 2x the parallelism
        which should be good for most pipelines.
