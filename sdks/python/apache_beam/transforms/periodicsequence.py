  ImpulseSeqGenDoFn fn receives tuple elements with three parts:

  * first_timestamp = The timestamp of the first element to be generated
    (inclusive).
  * last_timestamp = The timestamp marking the end of the generation period
    (exclusive). No elements will be generated at or after this time.
  * fire_interval = how often to fire an element.

  For each input element received, ImpulseSeqGenDoFn fn will start
  generating output elements in following pattern:

  * if element timestamp is less than current runtime then output element.
  * if element timestamp is greater than current runtime, wait until next
    element timestamp.

  ImpulseSeqGenDoFn can't guarantee that each element is output at exact time.
  ImpulseSeqGenDoFn guarantees that elements would not be output prior to
  given runtime timestamp.

  The output mode of the DoFn is based on the input `data`:

    - **None**: If `data` is None (by default), the output element will be the
      timestamp.
    - **Non-Timestamped Data**: If `data` is a sequence of arbitrary values
      (e.g., `[v1, v2, ...]`), the DoFn will assign a timestamp to each
      emitted element.
    - **Pre-Timestamped Data**: If `data` is a sequence of tuples, where each
      tuple is `(apache_beam.utils.timestamp.Timestamp, value)`, the DoFn
      will use the provided timestamp for the emitted element.

  See the parameter description of `PeriodicImpulse` for more information.

    :param data: A sequence of elements to emit. The behavior depends on the
      content:

      - **None (default):** The transform emits the event timestamps as
        the element values, starting from start_timestamp and incrementing by
        `fire_interval` up to the `stop_timestamp` (exclusive)
      - **Sequence of raw values (e.g., `['a', 'b']`)**: The transform emits
        each value in the sequence, assigning it an event timestamp that is
        calculated in the same manner as the default scenario. The sequence
        is repeated if the impulse duration requires more elements than
        are in the sequence (a warning will be given in this case).
      - **Sequence of pre-timestamped tuples (e.g.,
        `[(t1, v1), (t2, v2)]`)**: The transform emits each value with its
        explicitly provided event time. The format must be
        `(apache_beam.utils.timestamp.Timestamp, value)`. The provided
        timestamps are used directly, overriding the calculated ones.
        Note that the elements in the sequence is NOT required to be ordered
        by event time; an element with a timestamp earlier than a preceding one
        will be treated as a potential late event.
        **Important**: In this mode, the number of elements in `data` must be
        sufficient to cover the duration defined by `start_timestamp`,
        `stop_timestamp`, and `fire_interval`; otherwise, a `ValueError` is
        raised.
