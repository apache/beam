  """Groups results across several PCollections by key.

  Given an input dict mapping serializable keys (called "tags") to 0 or more
  PCollections of (key, value) tuples, e.g.::

     {'pc1': pcoll1, 'pc2': pcoll2, 33333: pcoll3}

  creates a single output PCollection of (key, value) tuples whose keys are the
  unique input keys from all inputs, and whose values are dicts mapping each
  tag to an iterable of whatever values were under the key in the corresponding
  PCollection::

    ('some key', {'pc1': ['value 1 under "some key" in pcoll1',
                          'value 2 under "some key" in pcoll1'],
                  'pc2': [],
                  33333: ['only value under "some key" in pcoll3']})

  Note that pcoll2 had no values associated with "some key".

  CoGroupByKey also works for tuples, lists, or other flat iterables of
  PCollections, in which case the values of the resulting PCollections
  will be tuples whose nth value is the list of values from the nth
  PCollection---conceptually, the "tags" are the indices into the input.
  Thus, for this input::

     (pcoll1, pcoll2, pcoll3)

  the output PCollection's value for "some key" is::

    ('some key', (['value 1 under "some key" in pcoll1',
                   'value 2 under "some key" in pcoll1'],
                  [],
                  ['only value under "some key" in pcoll3']))

  Args:
    label: name of this transform instance. Useful while monitoring and
      debugging a pipeline execution.
    **kwargs: Accepts a single named argument "pipeline", which specifies the
      pipeline that "owns" this PTransform. Ordinarily CoGroupByKey can obtain
      this information from one of the input PCollections, but if there are none
      (or if there's a chance there may be none), this argument is the only way
      to provide pipeline information, and should be considered mandatory.
