  Note this test must be executed with pipeline options that run jobs on a local
  job server. The easiest way to accomplish this is to run the
  `validatesCrossLanguageRunnerPythonUsingSql` gradle target for a particular
  job server, which will start the runner and job server for you. For example,
  `:runners:flink:1.10:job-server:validatesCrossLanguageRunnerPythonUsingSql` to
  test on Flink 1.10.

  Alternatively, you may be able to iterate faster if you run the tests directly
  using a runner like `FlinkRunner`, which can start a local Flink cluster and
  job server for you:
    $ pip install -e './sdks/python[gcp,test]'
    $ python ./sdks/python/setup.py nosetests \\
        --tests apache_beam.transforms.sql_test \\
