"""Nexmark Query 0: Pass through (send and receive auction events).

The Nexmark suite is a series of queries (streaming pipelines) performed
on a simulation of auction events.

This query is a pass through that
simply parses the events generated by the launcher. It serves as a test
to verify the infrastructure.
