"""
Query 3, 'Local Item Suggestion'. Who is selling in OR, ID or CA in category
10, and for what auction ids? In CQL syntax::

  SELECT Istream(P.name, P.city, P.state, A.id)
  FROM Auction A [ROWS UNBOUNDED], Person P [ROWS UNBOUNDED]
  WHERE A.seller = P.id
    AND (P.state = `OR' OR P.state = `ID' OR P.state = `CA')
    AND A.category = 10;

We'll implement this query to allow 'new auction' events to come before the
'new person' events for the auction seller. Those auctions will be stored until
the matching person is seen. Then all subsequent auctions for a person will use
the stored person record.
