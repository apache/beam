"""Utilities for the Nexmark suite.

The Nexmark suite is a series of queries (streaming pipelines) performed
on a simulation of auction events. This util includes:

  - A Command class used to terminate the streaming jobs
    launched in nexmark_launcher.py by the DirectRunner.
  - A ParseEventFn DoFn to parse events received from PubSub.

Usage:

To run a process for a certain duration, define in the code:
  command = Command(process_to_terminate, args)
  command.run(timeout=duration)
