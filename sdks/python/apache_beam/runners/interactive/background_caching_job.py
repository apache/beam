"""Module to build and run background caching job.

For internal use only; no backwards-compatibility guarantees.

A background caching job is a job that caches events for all unbounded sources
of a given pipeline. With Interactive Beam, one such job is started when a
pipeline run happens (which produces a main job in contrast to the background
caching job) and meets the following conditions:

  #. The pipeline contains unbounded sources.
  #. No such background job is running.
  #. No such background job has completed successfully and the cached events are
     still valid (invalidated when unbounded sources change in the pipeline).

Once started, the background caching job runs asynchronously until it hits some
cache size limit. Meanwhile, the main job and future main jobs from the pipeline
will run using the deterministic replay-able cached events until they are
invalidated.
