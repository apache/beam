    "[Beam SQL](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/sql/overview/) allows a Beam user to query PCollections with SQL statements. Currently, `InteractiveRunner` does not support `SqlTransform` due to [BEAM-10708](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10708). However, a user could use the `beam_sql` magic to run Beam SQL in the notebook and introspect the result.\n",

If you're not familiar with magics, here are some [built-in examples](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). It's a convenient way to validate your queries locally against known/test data sources when prototyping a Beam pipeline with SQL, before productionizing it on remote cluster/services.\n",
