"""Tests for BundleProcessor creation lull logging.

This test file specifically tests the fix for GitHub issue #36022:
https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/36022

The issue was that work threads stuck at deserializing DoFn in Python pipelines
were not showing "Operation ongoing..." logs because active_bundle_processors
was only updated after BundleProcessor creation completed.
