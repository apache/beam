"""State sampler for tracking time spent in execution steps.

The state sampler profiles the time spent in each step of a pipeline.
Operations (defined in executor.py) which are executed as part of a MapTask are
instrumented with context managers provided by StateSampler.scoped_state().
These context managers change the internal state of the StateSampler during each
relevant Operation's .start(), .process() and .finish() methods.  State is
sampled by a raw C thread, not holding the Python Global Interpreter Lock, which
queries the StateSampler's internal state at a defined sampling frequency.  In a
common example, a ReadOperation during its .start() method reads an element and
calls a DoOperation's .process() method, which can call a WriteOperation's
.process() method.  Each element processed causes the current state to
transition between these states of different Operations.  Each time the sampling
thread queries the current state, the time spent since the previous sample is
attributed to that state and accumulated.  Over time, this allows a granular
runtime profile to be produced.
