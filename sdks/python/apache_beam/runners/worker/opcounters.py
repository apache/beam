    Size calculation can be expensive, so we don't do it for each element.
    Because we need only an estimate of average size, we sample.

    We always sample the first 10 elements, then the sampling rate
    is approximately 10/N.  After reading N elements, of the next N,
    we will sample approximately 10*ln(2) (about 7) elements.

    This algorithm samples at the same rate as Reservoir Sampling, but
    it never throws away early results.  (Because we keep only a
    running accumulation, storage is not a problem, so there is no
    need to discard earlier calculations.)

    Because we accumulate and do not replace, our statistics are
    biased toward early data.  If the data are distributed uniformly,
    this is not a problem.  If the data change over time (i.e., the
    element size tends to grow or shrink over time), our estimate will
    show the bias.  We could correct this by giving weight N to each
    sample, since each sample is a stand-in for the N/(10*ln(2))
    samples around it, which is proportional to N.  Since we do not
    expect biased data, for efficiency we omit the extra multiplication.
    We could reduce the early-data bias by putting a lower bound on
    the sampling rate.

    Computing random.randint(1, self._sample_counter) for each element
    is too slow, so when the sample size is big enough (we estimate 30
    is big enough), we estimate the size of the gap after each sample.
    This estimation allows us to call random much less often.

      True if it is time to compute another element's size.
