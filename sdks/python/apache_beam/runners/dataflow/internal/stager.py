"""Support for installing custom code and required dependencies.

Workflows, with the exception of very simple ones, are organized in multiple
modules and packages. Typically, these modules and packages have
dependencies on other standard libraries. Dataflow relies on the Python
setuptools package to handle these scenarios. For further details please read:
https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html

When a runner tries to run a pipeline it will check for a --requirements_file
and a --setup_file option.

If --setup_file is present then it is assumed that the folder containing the
file specified by the option has the typical layout required by setuptools and
it will run 'python setup.py sdist' to produce a source distribution. The
resulting tarball (a .tar or .tar.gz file) will be staged at the GCS staging
location specified as job option. When a worker starts it will check for the
presence of this file and will run 'easy_install tarball' to install the
package in the worker.

If --requirements_file is present then the file specified by the option will be
staged in the GCS staging location.  When a worker starts it will check for the
presence of this file and will run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. A
requirements file can be easily generated by running 'pip freeze -r
requirements.txt'. The reason a Dataflow runner does not run this automatically
is because quite often only a small fraction of the dependencies present in a
requirements.txt file are actually needed for remote execution and therefore a
one-time manual trimming is desirable.

TODO(silviuc): Staged files should have a job specific prefix.
To prevent several jobs in the same project stomping on each other due to a
shared staging location.

TODO(silviuc): Should we allow several setup packages?
TODO(silviuc): We should allow customizing the exact command for setup build.
