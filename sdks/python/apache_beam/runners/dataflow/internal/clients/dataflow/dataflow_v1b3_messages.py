  Fields:
    consumedParallelism: Total amount of parallelism in the portion of input
      of this task that has already been consumed and is no longer active. In
      the first two examples above (see remaining_parallelism), the value
      should be 29 or 2 respectively.  The sum of remaining_parallelism and
      consumed_parallelism should equal the total amount of parallelism in
      this work item.  If specified, must be finite.
    fractionConsumed: Completion as fraction of the input consumed, from 0.0
      (beginning, nothing consumed), to 1.0 (end of the input, entire input
      consumed).
    position: A Position within the work to represent a progress.
    remainingParallelism: Total amount of parallelism in the input of this
      task that remains, (i.e. can be delegated to this task and any new tasks
      via dynamic splitting). Always at least 1 for non-finished work items
      and 0 for finished.  "Amount of parallelism" refers to how many non-
      empty parts of the input can be read in parallel. This does not
      necessarily equal number of records. An input that can be read in
      parallel down to the individual records is called "perfectly
      splittable". An example of non-perfectly parallelizable input is a
      block-compressed file format where a block of records has to be read as
      a whole, but different blocks can be read in parallel.  Examples: * If
      we are processing record #30 (starting at 1) out of 50 in a perfectly
      splittable 50-record input, this value should be 21 (20 remaining + 1
      current). * If we are reading through block 3 in a block-compressed file
      consisting   of 5 blocks, this value should be 3 (since blocks 4 and 5
      can be   processed in parallel by new tasks via dynamic splitting and
      the current   task remains processing block 3). * If we are reading
      through the last block in a block-compressed file,   or reading or
      processing the last record in a perfectly splittable   input, this value
      should be 1, because apart from the current task, no   additional

      default.  This should be in the form of the API service name, e.g.
      "compute.googleapis.com".
    dataset: The dataset for the current project where various workflow
      related tables are stored.  The supported resource type is:  Google
      BigQuery:   bigquery.googleapis.com/{dataset}
    experiments: The list of experiments to enable.
    internalExperiments: Experimental settings.
    sdkPipelineOptions: The Cloud Dataflow SDK pipeline options specified by
      the user. These options are passed through the service and are used to
      recreate the SDK pipeline options on the worker in a language agnostic
      and platform independent way.
    serviceAccountEmail: Identity to run virtual machines as. Defaults to the
      default account.
    tempStoragePrefix: The prefix of the resources the system should use for
      temporary storage.  The system will append the suffix "/temp-{JOBNAME}
      to this resource prefix, where {JOBNAME} is the value of the job_name
      field.  The resulting bucket and object prefix is used as the prefix of
      the resources used to store temporary data needed during the job
      execution.  NOTE: This will override the value in taskrunner_settings.
      The supported resource type is:  Google Cloud Storage:
      storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}/{object}
      bucket.storage.googleapis.com/{object}
    userAgent: A description of the process that generated the request.
    version: A structure describing which components and their versions of the
      service are required in order to run the job.
    workerPools: The worker pools. At least one "harness" worker pool must be
      specified in order for the job to have workers.

  """The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
  if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message
  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error
  conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
  some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
  message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
  APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
  environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
  If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
  the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
  Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
  have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.  - Batch operations. If
  a client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
  should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-
  response.  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous
  operation     results in its response, the status of those operations should
  be     represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some
  API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

      returning the residual part into the pool of available work. This event
      is called a "dynamic split" and is critical to the dynamic work
      rebalancing feature. The two obtained sub-tasks are called "parts" of
      the split. The parts, if concatenated, must represent the same input as
      would be read by the current task if the split did not happen. The exact
      way in which the original task is decomposed into the two parts is
      specified either as a position demarcating them (stop_position), or
      explicitly as two DerivedSources, if this task consumes a user-defined
      source type (dynamic_source_split).  The "current" task is adjusted as a
      result of the split: after a task with range [A, B) sends a
      stop_position update at C, its range is considered to be [A, C), e.g.: *
      Progress should be interpreted relative to the new range, e.g.   "75%
      completed" means "75% of [A, C) completed" * The worker should interpret
      proposed_stop_position relative to the   new range, e.g. "split at 68%"
      should be interpreted as   "split at 68% of [A, C)". * If the worker
      chooses to split again using stop_position, only   stop_positions in [A,
      C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics:
      e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P,
      R} (where P and R must be together equivalent to S), then subsequent
      progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P,
      and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P', R'}, P' and

    network: Network to which VMs will be assigned.  If empty or unspecified,
      the service will use the network "default".
    numThreadsPerWorker: The number of threads per worker harness. If empty or
      unspecified, the service will choose a number of threads (according to
      the number of cores on the selected machine type for batch, or 1 by
      convention for streaming).
    numWorkers: Number of Google Compute Engine workers in this pool needed to
      execute the job.  If zero or unspecified, the service will attempt to
      choose a reasonable default.
    onHostMaintenance: The action to take on host maintenance, as defined by
      the Google Compute Engine API.
    packages: Packages to be installed on workers.
    poolArgs: Extra arguments for this worker pool.
    subnetwork: Subnetwork to which VMs will be assigned, if desired.
      Expected to be of the form "regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNETWORK".
    taskrunnerSettings: Settings passed through to Google Compute Engine
      workers when using the standard Dataflow task runner.  Users should
      ignore this field.
    teardownPolicy: Sets the policy for determining when to turndown worker
      pool. Allowed values are: `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`, `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS`, and
      `TEARDOWN_NEVER`. `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS` means workers are always torn down
      regardless of whether the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS` means
      workers are torn down if the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_NEVER` means the
      workers are never torn down.  If the workers are not torn down by the
      service, they will continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM
      resources in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated by
      the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`
      policy except for small, manually supervised test jobs.  If unknown or
      unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.
    workerHarnessContainerImage: Required. Docker container image that
      executes the Cloud Dataflow worker harness, residing in Google Container
      Registry.
    zone: Zone to run the worker pools in.  If empty or unspecified, the
      service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.
