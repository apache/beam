"""Retry decorators for calls raising exceptions.

For internal use only; no backwards-compatibility guarantees.

This module is used mostly to decorate all integration points where the code
makes calls to remote services. Searching through the code base for @retry
should find all such places. For this reason even places where retry is not
needed right now use a @retry.no_retries decorator.

  Args:

    initial_delay_secs: The delay before the first retry, in seconds.
    logger: A callable used to report an exception. Must have the same signature
      as functions in the standard logging module. The default is
      _LOGGER.warning.
    retry_filter: A callable getting the exception raised and returning True
      if the retry should happen. For instance we do not want to retry on
      404 Http errors most of the time. The default value will return true
      for server errors (HTTP status code >= 500) and non Http errors.
    clock: A clock object implementing a sleep method. The default clock will
      use time.sleep().
    fuzz: True if the delay should be fuzzed (default). During testing False
      can be used so that the delays are not randomized.
    factor: The exponential factor to use on subsequent retries.
      Default is 2 (doubling).
    max_delay_secs: Maximum delay (in seconds). After this limit is reached,
      further tries use max_delay_sec instead of exponentially increasing
      the time. Defaults to 1 hour.

  Returns:
    As per Python decorators with arguments pattern returns a decorator
    for the function which in turn will return the wrapped (decorated) function.

  The decorator is intended to be used on callables that make HTTP or RPC
  requests that can temporarily timeout or have transient errors. For instance
  the make_http_request() call below will be retried 16 times with exponential
  backoff and fuzzing of the delay interval (default settings).
