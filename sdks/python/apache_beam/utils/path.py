def join(path, *paths):
  """Joins given path pieces with the appropriate separator.

  This function is useful for joining parts of a path that could at times refer
  to either a GCS path or a local path.  In particular, this is useful for
  ensuring Windows compatibility as on Windows, the GCS path separator is
  different from the separator for local paths.

  Use os.path.join instead if a path always refers to a local path.

  Args:
    path: First part of path to join.  If this part starts with 'gs:/', the GCS
      separator will be used in joining this path.
    *paths: Remaining part(s) of path to join.

  Returns:
    Pieces joined by the appropriate path separator.
  """

    # that function has the undesirable behavior of having, for example,
    # posixpath.join('gs://bucket/path', '/to/file') return '/to/file' instead
    # of the slightly less surprising result 'gs://bucket/path//to/file'.
