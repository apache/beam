"""An integration test for datastore_write_it_pipeline

This test creates entities and writes them to Cloud Datastore. Subsequently,
these entities are read from Cloud Datastore, compared to the expected value
for the entity, and deleted.

There is no output; instead, we use `assert_that` transform to verify the
results in the pipeline.
