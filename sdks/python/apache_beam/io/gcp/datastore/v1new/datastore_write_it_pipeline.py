"""A job that write Entries into Datastore.

The pipelines behave in the steps below.

  1. Create and write Entities to Datastore
  2. (Optional) If read limit was provided,
     read it and confirm that the expected Entities were read.
  3. Query the written Entities and verify result.
  4. Delete Entries.
  5. Query the written Entities, verify no results.
