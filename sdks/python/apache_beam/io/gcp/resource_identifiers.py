"""Helper functions to generate resource labels strings for GCP entitites

These can be used on MonitoringInfo 'resource' labels.

See example entities:
    https://s.apache.org/beam-gcp-debuggability

For GCP entities, populate the RESOURCE label with the aip.dev/122 format:
https://google.aip.dev/122

If an official GCP format does not exist, try to use the following format.
    //whatever.googleapis.com/parents/{parentId}/whatevers/{whateverId}
