class RangeTracker(object):
  """A thread safe object used by Dataflow source framework.

  A Dataflow source is defined using a ''BoundedSource'' and a ''RangeTracker''
  pair. A ''RangeTracker'' is used by Dataflow source framework to perform
  dynamic work rebalancing of position-based sources.

  **Position-based sources**

  A position-based source is one where the source can be described by a range
  of positions of an ordered type and the records returned by the reader can be
  described by positions of the same type.

  In case a record occupies a range of positions in the source, the most
  important thing about the record is the position where it starts.

  Defining the semantics of positions for a source is entirely up to the source
  class, however the chosen definitions have to obey certain properties in order
  to make it possible to correctly split the source into parts, including
  dynamic splitting. Two main aspects need to be defined:

  1. How to assign starting positions to records.
  2. Which records should be read by a source with a range '[A, B)'.

  Moreover, reading a range must be *efficient*, i.e., the performance of
  reading a range should not significantly depend on the location of the range.
  For example, reading the range [A, B) should not require reading all data
  before 'A'.

  The sections below explain exactly what properties these definitions must
  satisfy, and how to use a ``RangeTracker`` with a properly defined source.

  **Properties of position-based sources**

  The main requirement for position-based sources is *associativity*: reading
  records from '[A, B)' and records from '[B, C)' should give the same
  records as reading from '[A, C)', where 'A <= B <= C'. This property
  ensures that no matter how a range of positions is split into arbitrarily many
  sub-ranges, the total set of records described by them stays the same.

  The other important property is how the source's range relates to positions of
  records in the source. In many sources each record can be identified by a
  unique starting position. In this case:

  * All records returned by a source '[A, B)' must have starting positions in
    this range.
  * All but the last record should end within this range. The last record may or
    may not extend past the end of the range.
  * Records should not overlap.

  Such sources should define "read '[A, B)'" as "read from the first record
  starting at or after 'A', up to but not including the first record starting
  at or after 'B'".

  Some examples of such sources include reading lines or CSV from a text file,
  reading keys and values from a BigTable, etc.

  The concept of *split points* allows to extend the definitions for dealing
  with sources where some records cannot be identified by a unique starting
  position.

  In all cases, all records returned by a source '[A, B)' must *start* at or
  after 'A'.

  **Split points**

  Some sources may have records that are not directly addressable. For example,
  imagine a file format consisting of a sequence of compressed blocks. Each
  block can be assigned an offset, but records within the block cannot be
  directly addressed without decompressing the block. Let us refer to this
  hypothetical format as <i>CBF (Compressed Blocks Format)</i>.

  Many such formats can still satisfy the associativity property. For example,
  in CBF, reading '[A, B)' can mean "read all the records in all blocks whose
  starting offset is in '[A, B)'".

  To support such complex formats, we introduce the notion of *split points*. We
  say that a record is a split point if there exists a position 'A' such that
  the record is the first one to be returned when reading the range
  '[A, infinity)'. In CBF, the only split points would be the first records
  in each block.

  Split points allow us to define the meaning of a record's position and a
  source's range in all cases:

  * For a record that is at a split point, its position is defined to be the
    largest 'A' such that reading a source with the range '[A, infinity)'
    returns this record.
  * Positions of other records are only required to be non-decreasing.
  * Reading the source '[A, B)' must return records starting from the first
    split point at or after 'A', up to but not including the first split point
    at or after 'B'. In particular, this means that the first record returned
    by a source MUST always be a split point.
  * Positions of split points must be unique.

  As a result, for any decomposition of the full range of the source into
  position ranges, the total set of records will be the full set of records in
  the source, and each record will be read exactly once.

  **Consumed positions**

  As the source is being read, and records read from it are being passed to the
  downstream transforms in the pipeline, we say that positions in the source are
  being *consumed*. When a reader has read a record (or promised to a caller
  that a record will be returned), positions up to and including the record's
  start position are considered *consumed*.

  Dynamic splitting can happen only at *unconsumed* positions. If the reader
  just returned a record at offset 42 in a file, dynamic splitting can happen
  only at offset 43 or beyond, as otherwise that record could be read twice (by
  the current reader and by a reader of the task starting at 43).

      * Before a source read (``BoundedSource.read()`` invocation) claims the

        holds independent of whether the input is "splittable". A splittable
        source is a source that has more than one split point.
      * Any source read that has only claimed one split point has 0 consumed
        split points since the first split point is the current split point and
        is still being processed. This condition holds independent of whether
        the input is splittable.
      * For an empty source read which never invokes
        ``RangeTracker.try_claim()``, the consumed number of split points is 0.
        This condition holds independent of whether the input is splittable.
      * For a source read which has invoked ``RangeTracker.try_claim()`` n
        times, the consumed number of split points is  n -1.
      * If a ``BoundedSource`` sets a callback through function
        ``set_split_points_unclaimed_callback()``, ``RangeTracker`` can use that
        callback when determining remaining number of split points.
      * Remaining split points should include the split point that is currently
        being consumed by the source read. Hence if the above callback returns
        an integer value n, remaining number of split points should be (n + 1).
      * After last split point is claimed remaining split points becomes 1,
        because this unfinished read itself represents an  unfinished split
        point.
      * After all records of the source has been consumed, remaining number of
        split points becomes 0 and consumed number of split points becomes equal
        to the total number of split points within the range being read by the
        source. This method does not address this condition and will continue to
        report number of consumed split points as
        ("total number of split points" - 1) and number of remaining split
        points as 1. A runner that performs the reading of the source can
        detect when all records have been consumed and adjust remaining and
        consumed number of split points accordingly.

    ** Examples **

    (1) A "perfectly splittable" input which can be read in parallel down to the
        individual records.

        Consider a perfectly splittable input that consists of 50 split points.

      * Before a source read (``BoundedSource.read()`` invocation) claims the
        first split point, number of consumed split points is 0 number of
        remaining split points is 50.
      * After claiming first split point, consumed number of split points is 0
        and remaining number of split is 50.
      * After claiming split point #30, consumed number of split points is 29
        and remaining number of split points is 21.
      * After claiming all 50 split points, consumed number of split points is
        49 and remaining number of split points is 1.

    (2) a "block-compressed" file format such as ``avroio``, in which a block of
        records has to be read as a whole, but different blocks can be read in
        parallel.

        Consider a block compressed input that consists of 5 blocks.

      * Before a source read (``BoundedSource.read()`` invocation) claims the
        first split point (first block), number of consumed split points is 0
        number of remaining split points is 5.
      * After claiming first split point, consumed number of split points is 0
        and remaining number of split is 5.
      * After claiming split point #3, consumed number of split points is 2
        and remaining number of split points is 3.
      * After claiming all 5 split points, consumed number of split points is
        4 and remaining number of split points is 1.

    (3) an "unsplittable" input such as a cursor in a database or a gzip
        compressed file.

        Such an input is considered to have only a single split point. Number of
        consumed split points is always 0 and number of remaining split points
        is always 1.

    By default ``RangeTracker` returns ``RangeTracker.SPLIT_POINTS_UNKNOWN`` for
    both consumed and remaining number of split points, which indicates that the
    number of split points consumed and remaining is unknown.

      A pair that gives consumed and remaining number of split points. Consumed

class Sink(HasDisplayData):
  """This class is deprecated, no backwards-compatibility guarantees.

  A resource that can be written to using the ``beam.io.Write`` transform.

  Here ``beam`` stands for Apache Beam Python code imported in following manner.
  ``import apache_beam as beam``.

  A parallel write to an ``iobase.Sink`` consists of three phases:

  1. A sequential *initialization* phase (e.g., creating a temporary output
     directory, etc.)
  2. A parallel write phase where workers write *bundles* of records
  3. A sequential *finalization* phase (e.g., committing the writes, merging
     output files, etc.)

  Implementing a new sink requires extending two classes.

  1. iobase.Sink

  ``iobase.Sink`` is an immutable logical description of the location/resource
  to write to. Depending on the type of sink, it may contain fields such as the
  path to an output directory on a filesystem, a database table name,
  etc. ``iobase.Sink`` provides methods for performing a write operation to the
  sink described by it. To this end, implementors of an extension of
  ``iobase.Sink`` must implement three methods:
  ``initialize_write()``, ``open_writer()``, and ``finalize_write()``.

  2. iobase.Writer

  ``iobase.Writer`` is used to write a single bundle of records. An
  ``iobase.Writer`` defines two methods: ``write()`` which writes a
  single record from the bundle and ``close()`` which is called once
  at the end of writing a bundle.

  See also ``apache_beam.io.filebasedsink.FileBasedSink`` which provides a
  simpler API for writing sinks that produce files.

  **Execution of the Write transform**

  ``initialize_write()``, ``pre_finalize()``, and ``finalize_write()`` are
  conceptually called once. However, implementors must
  ensure that these methods are *idempotent*, as they may be called multiple
  times on different machines in the case of failure/retry. A method may be
  called more than once concurrently, in which case it's okay to have a
  transient failure (such as due to a race condition). This failure should not
  prevent subsequent retries from succeeding.

  ``initialize_write()`` should perform any initialization that needs to be done
  prior to writing to the sink. ``initialize_write()`` may return a result
  (let's call this ``init_result``) that contains any parameters it wants to
  pass on to its writers about the sink. For example, a sink that writes to a
  file system may return an ``init_result`` that contains a dynamically
  generated unique directory to which data should be written.

  To perform writing of a bundle of elements, Dataflow execution engine will
  create an ``iobase.Writer`` using the implementation of
  ``iobase.Sink.open_writer()``. When invoking ``open_writer()`` execution
  engine will provide the ``init_result`` returned by ``initialize_write()``
  invocation as well as a *bundle id* (let's call this ``bundle_id``) that is
  unique for each invocation of ``open_writer()``.

  Execution engine will then invoke ``iobase.Writer.write()`` implementation for
  each element that has to be written. Once all elements of a bundle are
  written, execution engine will invoke ``iobase.Writer.close()`` implementation
  which should return a result (let's call this ``write_result``) that contains
  information that encodes the result of the write and, in most cases, some
  encoding of the unique bundle id. For example, if each bundle is written to a
  unique temporary file, ``close()`` method may return an object that contains
  the temporary file name. After writing of all bundles is complete, execution
  engine will invoke ``pre_finalize()`` and then ``finalize_write()``
  implementation.

  The execution of a write transform can be illustrated using following pseudo
  code (assume that the outer for loop happens in parallel across many
  machines)::

    init_result = sink.initialize_write()
    write_results = []
    for bundle in partition(pcoll):
      writer = sink.open_writer(init_result, generate_bundle_id())
      for elem in bundle:
        writer.write(elem)
      write_results.append(writer.close())
    pre_finalize_result = sink.pre_finalize(init_result, write_results)
    sink.finalize_write(init_result, write_results, pre_finalize_result)


  **init_result**

  Methods of 'iobase.Sink' should agree on the 'init_result' type that will be
  returned when initializing the sink. This type can be a client-defined object
  or an existing type. The returned type must be picklable using Dataflow coder
  ``coders.PickleCoder``. Returning an init_result is optional.

  **bundle_id**

  In order to ensure fault-tolerance, a bundle may be executed multiple times
  (e.g., in the event of failure/retry or for redundancy). However, exactly one
  of these executions will have its result passed to the
  ``iobase.Sink.finalize_write()`` method. Each call to
  ``iobase.Sink.open_writer()`` is passed a unique bundle id when it is called
  by the ``WriteImpl`` transform, so even redundant or retried bundles will have
  a unique way of identifying their output.

  The bundle id should be used to guarantee that a bundle's output is unique.
  This uniqueness guarantee is important; if a bundle is to be output to a file,
  for example, the name of the file must be unique to avoid conflicts with other
  writers. The bundle id should be encoded in the writer result returned by the
  writer and subsequently used by the ``finalize_write()`` method to identify
  the results of successful writes.

  For example, consider the scenario where a Writer writes files containing
  serialized records and the ``finalize_write()`` is to merge or rename these
  output files. In this case, a writer may use its unique id to name its output
  file (to avoid conflicts) and return the name of the file it wrote as its
  writer result. The ``finalize_write()`` will then receive an ``Iterable`` of
  output file names that it can then merge or rename using some bundle naming
  scheme.

  **write_result**

  ``iobase.Writer.close()`` and ``finalize_write()`` implementations must agree
  on type of the ``write_result`` object returned when invoking
  ``iobase.Writer.close()``. This type can be a client-defined object or
  an existing type. The returned type must be picklable using Dataflow coder
  ``coders.PickleCoder``. Returning a ``write_result`` when
  ``iobase.Writer.close()`` is invoked is optional but if unique
  ``write_result`` objects are not returned, sink should, guarantee idempotency
  when same bundle is written multiple times due to failure/retry or redundancy.
