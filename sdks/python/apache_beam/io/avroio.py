"""``PTransforms`` for reading from and writing to Avro files.

Provides two read ``PTransform``s, ``ReadFromAvro`` and ``ReadAllFromAvro``,
that produces a ``PCollection`` of records.
Each record of this ``PCollection`` will contain a single record read from
an Avro file. Records that are of simple types will be mapped into
corresponding Python types. Records that are of Avro type 'RECORD' will be
mapped to Python dictionaries that comply with the schema contained in the
Avro file that contains those records. In this case, keys of each dictionary
will contain the corresponding field names and will be of type ``string``
while the values of the dictionary will be of the type defined in the
corresponding Avro schema.

For example, if schema of the Avro file is the following.
{"namespace": "example.avro","type": "record","name": "User","fields":
[{"name": "name", "type": "string"},
{"name": "favorite_number",  "type": ["int", "null"]},
{"name": "favorite_color", "type": ["string", "null"]}]}

Then records generated by read transforms will be dictionaries of the
following form.
{'name': 'Alyssa', 'favorite_number': 256, 'favorite_color': None}).

Additionally, this module provides a write ``PTransform`` ``WriteToAvro``
that can be used to write a given ``PCollection`` of Python objects to an
Avro file.
