# Example RunInference API Pipelines

This module contains example pipelines that use the Beam RunInference
API. <!---TODO: Add link to full documentation on Beam website when it's published.-->

## Pre-requisites

You must have `apache-beam>=2.40.0` installed in order to run these pipelines,
because the `apache_beam.examples.inference` module was added in that release.
```
pip install apache-beam==2.40.0
```

### Pytorch dependencies
The RunInference API has support for the Pytorch framework. To use Pytorch locally, first install `torch`.
```
pip install torch==1.11.0
```

For installation of the `torch` dependency on a distributed runner, like Dataflow, refer to these
[instructions](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#pypi-dependencies).

<!---
TODO: Add link to full documentation on Beam website when it's published.

i.e. "See the
[documentation](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/dataframes/overview/#pre-requisites)
for details."
-->

### Datasets and Models for RunInference
Data related to RunInference has been staged in
`gs://apache-beam-ml/` for use with these example pipelines. You can view the data [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/apache-beam-ml). You also can see this by using the [gsutil tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil#gettingstarted).
```
gsutil ls gs://apache-beam-ml
```

## Image Classification with ImageNet dataset

[`pytorch_image_classification.py`](./pytorch_image_classification.py) contains
an implementation for a RunInference pipeline thatpeforms image classification
on [ImageNet dataset](https://www.image-net.org/) using the MobileNetV2
architecture.

The pipeline reads the images, performs basic preprocessing, passes them to the
PyTorch implementation of RunInference, and then writes the predictions
to a text file in GCS.

### Dataset and model for Image Classification

<!---
TODO: Add once benchmark test is released
- `gs://apache-beam-ml/testing/inputs/imagenet_validation_inputs.txt`:
  text file containing the GCS paths of the images of all 5000 imagenet validation data
    - gs://apache-beam-ml/datasets/imagenet/raw-data/validation/ILSVRC2012_val_00000001.JPEG
    - ...
    - gs://apache-beam-ml/datasets/imagenet/raw-data/validation/ILSVRC2012_val_00050000.JPEG
-->
- `gs://apache-beam-ml/testing/inputs/it_imagenet_validation_inputs.txt`:
  text file containing the GCS paths of the images of a subset of 15 imagenet
  validation data. See the following example command to view contents of the file:
```
$ gsutil cat gs://apache-beam-ml/testing/inputs/it_imagenet_validation_inputs.txt
gs://apache-beam-ml/datasets/imagenet/raw-data/validation/ILSVRC2012_val_00000001.JPEG
...
gs://apache-beam-ml/datasets/imagenet/raw-data/validation/ILSVRC2012_val_00000015.JPEG
```

- `gs://apache-beam-ml/datasets/imagenet/raw-data/validation/ILSVRC2012_val_*.JPEG`:
  JPEG images for the entire validation dataset.

- `gs://apache-beam-ml/models/torchvision.models.mobilenet_v2.pth`: Path to
  the location of the saved state_dict of the pretrained mobilenet_v2 model
  from the `torchvision.models` subdirectory.

### Running `pytorch_image_classification.py`

To run the image classification pipeline locally, use the following command:
```sh
python -m apache_beam.examples.inference.pytorch_image_classification \
  --input gs://apache-beam-ml/testing/inputs/it_imagenet_validation_inputs.txt \
  --output predictions.csv \
  --model_state_dict_path gs://apache-beam-ml/models/torchvision.models.mobilenet_v2.pth
```

This will write the output to the `predictions.csv` with contents like:
```
gs://apache-beam-ml/datasets/imagenet/raw-data/validation/ILSVRC2012_val_00005002.JPEG,333
gs://apache-beam-ml/datasets/imagenet/raw-data/validation/ILSVRC2012_val_00005003.JPEG,711
gs://apache-beam-ml/datasets/imagenet/raw-data/validation/ILSVRC2012_val_00005004.JPEG,286
...
```
where the second item in each line is the integer representing the predicted class of the
image.
