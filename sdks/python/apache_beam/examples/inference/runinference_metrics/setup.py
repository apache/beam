"""Setup.py module for the workflow's worker utilities.

All the workflow related code is gathered in a package that will be built as a
source distribution, staged in the staging area for the workflow being run and
then installed in the workers when they start running.

This behavior is triggered by specifying the --setup_file command line option
when running the workflow for remote execution.
