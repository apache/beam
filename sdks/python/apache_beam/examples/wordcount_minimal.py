"""A minimalist word-counting workflow that counts words in Shakespeare.

This is the first in a series of successively more detailed 'word count'
examples.

Next, see the wordcount pipeline, then the wordcount_debugging pipeline, for
more detailed examples that introduce additional concepts.

Concepts:

1. Reading data from text files
2. Specifying 'inline' transforms
3. Counting a PCollection
4. Writing data to Cloud Storage as text files

To execute this pipeline locally, first edit the code to specify the output
location. Output location could be a local file path or an output prefix
on GCS. (Only update the output location marked with the first CHANGE comment.)

To execute this pipeline remotely, first edit the code to set your project ID,
runner type, the staging location, the temp location, and the output location.
The specified GCS bucket(s) must already exist. (Update all the places marked
with a CHANGE comment.)

Then, run the pipeline as described in the README. It will be deployed and run
using the Google Cloud Dataflow Service. No args are required to run the
pipeline. You can see the results in your output bucket in the GCS browser.
