"""Simple tests to showcase combiners.

The tests are meant to be "copy/paste" code snippets for the topic they address
(combiners in this case). Most examples use neither sources nor sinks.
The input data is generated simply with a Create transform and the output is
checked directly on the last PCollection produced.
