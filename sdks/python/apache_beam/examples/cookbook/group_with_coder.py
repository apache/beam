"""An example of using custom classes and coder for grouping operations.

This workflow demonstrates registration and usage of a custom coder for a user-
defined class. A deterministic custom coder is needed to use a class as a key in
a combine or group operation.

This example assumes an input file with, on each line, a comma-separated name
and score.
