"""An example workflow that demonstrates filters and other features.

  - Reading and writing data from BigQuery.
  - Manipulating BigQuery rows (as Python dicts) in memory.
  - Global aggregates.
  - Filtering PCollections using both user-specified parameters
    as well as global aggregates computed during pipeline execution.
