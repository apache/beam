"""setup.py module for the pipeline package.

In this example, the pipeline code is gathered in a package that can be built
as source distribution and installed on the workers. The package is defined
in the pyproject.toml file. You can use setup.py file for defining 
configuration that needs to be determined programatically, for example,
custom commands to run when a package is installed.

You can install this package into the workers at runtime by using
the --setup_file pipeline option.

# Some custom command to run during setup. The command is not essential for this
# workflow. It is used here as an example. Each command will spawn a child
# process. Typically, these commands will include steps to install non-Python
# packages. For instance, to install a C++-based library libjpeg62 the following
# two commands will have to be added:
#
#     ['apt-get', 'update'],
#     ['apt-get', '--assume-yes', 'install', 'libjpeg62'],
#
# First, note that there is no need to use the sudo command because the setup
# script runs with appropriate access.
# Second, if apt-get tool is used then the first command needs to be 'apt-get
# update' so the tool refreshes itself and initializes links to download
# repositories.  Without this initial step the other apt-get install commands
# will fail with package not found errors. Note also --assume-yes option which
# shortcuts the interactive confirmation.
#
# Note that in this example custom commands will run after installing required
# packages. If you have a PyPI package that depends on one of the custom
# commands, move installation of the dependent package to the list of custom
# commands, e.g.:
#
#     ['pip', 'install', 'my_package'],
#
# TODO(https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/18568): Output from the custom
# commands are missing from the logs. The output of custom commands (including
# failures) will be logged in the worker-startup log.
