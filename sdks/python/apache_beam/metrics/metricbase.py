"""
The classes in this file are interfaces for metrics. They are not intended
to be subclassed or created directly by users. To work with and access metrics,
users should use the classes and methods exposed in metric.py.

Available classes:

- Metric - Base interface of a metrics object.
- Counter - Counter metric interface. Allows a count to be incremented or
    decremented during pipeline execution.
- Distribution - Distribution Metric interface. Allows statistics about the
    distribution of a variable to be collected during pipeline execution.
- Gauge - Gauge Metric interface. Allows to track the latest value of a
    variable during pipeline execution.
- MetricName - Namespace and name used to refer to a Metric.
