Description: nose extends the test loading and running features of unittest, making
            it easier to write, find and run tests.
        
            By default, nose will run tests in files or directories under the current
            working directory whose names include "test" or "Test" at a word boundary
            (like "test_this" or "functional_test" or "TestClass" but not
            "libtest"). Test output is similar to that of unittest, but also includes
            captured stdout output from failing tests, for easy print-style debugging.
        
            These features, and many more, are customizable through the use of
            plugins. Plugins included with nose provide support for doctest, code
            coverage and profiling, flexible attribute-based test selection,
            output capture and more. More information about writing plugins may be
            found on in the nose API documentation, here:

            the very latest, you may want the development version instead:
