/**
 * This interface allows you to implement a custom mapper to read and persist elements from/to
 * Cassandra.
 *
 * <p>To Implement a custom mapper you need to: 1) Create an implementation of {@link Mapper}. 2)
 * Create a {@link SerializableFunction} that instantiates the {@link Mapper} for a given Session,
 * for an example see {@link DefaultObjectMapperFactory}). 3) Pass this function to {@link
 * CassandraIO.Read#withMapperFactoryFn(SerializableFunction)} in the CassandraIO builder. <br>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * SerializableFunction<Session, Mapper> factory = new MyCustomFactory();
 * pipeline
 *    .apply(...)
 *    .apply(CassandraIO.<>read()
 *        .withMapperFactoryFn(factory));
 * }</pre>
