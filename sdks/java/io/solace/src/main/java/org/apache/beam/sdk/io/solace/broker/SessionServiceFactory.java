/**
 * This abstract class serves as a blueprint for creating `SessionServiceFactory` objects. It introduces a
 * queue property and mandates the implementation of a create() method in concrete subclasses.
 *
 * <p>For basic authentication, use {@link BasicAuthJcsmpSessionServiceFactory}</p>.
 *
 * <p>For other situations, you need to extend this class. Classes extending from this abstract class must implement the `equals` method so two instances
 * can be compared by value, and not by reference. We recommend using AutoValue for that.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * @AutoValue
 * public abstract class MyFactory implements SessionServiceClientFactory {
 *
 *   abstract String value1();
 *
 *   abstract String value2();
 *
 *   public static MyFactory create(String value1, String value2) {
 *     return new AutoValue_MyFactory.Builder(value1, value2);
 *   }
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   @Override
 *   public SessionService create() {
 *     ...
