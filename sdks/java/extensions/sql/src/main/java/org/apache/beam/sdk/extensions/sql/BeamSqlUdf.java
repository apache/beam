/**
 * Interface to create a UDF in Beam SQL.
 *
 * <p>A static method {@code eval} is required. Here is an example:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * public static class MyLeftFunction {
 *   public String eval(
 *       &#64;Parameter(name = "s") String s,
 *       &#64;Parameter(name = "n", optional = true) Integer n) {
 *     return s.substring(0, n == null ? 1 : n);
 *   }
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>The first parameter is named "s" and is mandatory,
 * and the second parameter is named "n" and is optional(always NULL if not specified).
