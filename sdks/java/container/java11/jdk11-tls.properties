# Java 11 java.security properties file override for JVM
# base properties derived from:
# openjdk 11.0.9 2020-10-20
# OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.9+11)
# OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.9+11, mixed mode)

# New versions of Java have now disabled TLSv1 and TLSv1.1
# 
# To prevent breakages caused by the deprecation of algorithms during JDK
# updates, we are explictly passing an override to these properties
# to the JVM as a meta option.
