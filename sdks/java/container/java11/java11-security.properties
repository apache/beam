# Java 11 java.security properties file override for JVM

# Java has now disabled TLSv1 and TLSv1.1. We specifically put it in the
# legacy algorithms list to allow it to be used if something better is not
# available (e.g. TLSv1.2). This will prevent breakages for existing users
# (for example JDBC with MySQL). See
# https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8202343
# for additional details.
#
# GCM is explicitly disabled in Java 8 only because it performs very
# poorly (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25992131/slow-aes-gcm-encryption-and-decryption-with-java-8u20)
# GCM is not disabled in Java 11 or 17 (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8046943)
#
# SSLv3 is explicitly disabled due to the potential for the POODLE attack. See
# https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA14-290A for additional details.
