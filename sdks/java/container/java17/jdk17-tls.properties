# Java 17 java.security properties file override for JVM
# base properties derived from:
# openjdk 17.0.2 2022-01-18
# OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.2+8-86)
# OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.2+8-86, mixed mode, sharing)

# New versions of Java have now disabled TLSv1 and TLSv1.1
# 
# To prevent breakages caused by the deprecation of algorithms during JDK
# updates, we are explictly passing an override to these properties
# to the JVM as a meta option.
