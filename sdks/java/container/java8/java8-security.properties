# Java has now disabled TLSv1 and TLSv1.1. We specifically put it in the
# legacy algorithms list to allow it to be used if something better is not
# available (e.g. TLSv1.2). This will prevent breakages for existing users
# (for example JDBC with MySQL). See

# /dev/random blocks in virtualized environments due to lack of
# good entropy sources, which makes SecureRandom use impractical.
# In particular, that affects the performance of HTTPS that relies
# on SecureRandom.
#
# Due to that, /dev/urandom is used as the default.
