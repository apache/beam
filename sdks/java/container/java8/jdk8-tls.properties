# Java 8 java.security properties file override for JVM
# base properties derived from:
# java version "1.8.0_151"
# Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12)
# Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)

# New versions of Java have now disabled TLSv1 and TLSv1.1
# 
# To prevent breakages caused by the deprecation of algorithms during JDK
# updates, we are explictly passing an override to these properties
# to the JVM as a meta option.
# NOTE: GCM is explicitly disabled in Java 8 only, not in Java 11 or 17
