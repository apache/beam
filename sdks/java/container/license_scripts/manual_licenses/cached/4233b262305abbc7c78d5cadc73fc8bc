 </ol>
 <h2 id="section-3">3. Distribution Obligations.</h2>
 <h3 id="section-3.1">3.1. Application of License.</h3>
 <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms
  of this License, including without limitation Section <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>. The
  Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
  or a future version of this License released under Section <a href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>,
  and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
  distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
  restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
  However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
  Section <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.
 <h3 id="section-3.2">3.2. Availability of Source Code.</h3>
 <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
  Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
  version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
  available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
  Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
  that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 <h3 id="section-3.3">3.3. Description of Modifications.</h3>
 <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
  changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
  Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
  (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
  in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 <h3 id="section-3.4">3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h3>
 <h4 id="section-3.4-a">(a) Third Party Claims</h4>
 <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property
  rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections
  <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>, Contributor must include a
  text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
  Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
  Section <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in
  all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
  notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
  received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 <h4 id="section-3.4-b">(b) Contributor APIs</h4>
 <p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor
  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that
  <abbr>API</abbr>, Contributor must also include this information in the
  <strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file.
 <h4 id="section-3.4-c">(c) Representations.</h4>
 <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4
  (<a href="#section-3.4-a">a</a>) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
  are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
  rights conveyed by this License.
 <h3 id="section-3.5">3.5. Required Notices.</h3>
 <p>You must duplicate the notice in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> in each file of the
  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
  its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
  where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
  Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
  <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
  for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
  Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
  must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
  as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 <h3 id="section-3.6">3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</h3>
 <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections
  <a href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>, <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>,
  <a href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>, <a href="#section-3.4">3.4</a> and
  <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
  notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
  of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
  of Section <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
  notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
  Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
  different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
  License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
  recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
  You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
  clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
  Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
  a result of any such terms You offer.
 <h3 id="section-3.7">3.7. Larger Works.</h3>
 <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
  terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
  You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 <h2 id="section-4">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h2>
 <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
  some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
  the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
  <strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file described in Section
  <a href="#section-3.4">3.4</a> and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 <h2 id="section-5">5. Application of this License.</h2>
 <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
  <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> and to related Covered Code.
 <h2 id="section-6">6. Versions of the License.</h2>
 <h3 id="section-6.1">6.1. New Versions</h3>
 <p>Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
 <h3 id="section-6.2">6.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>
 <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
  always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
  Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.
  No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
  created under this License.
 <h3 id="section-6.3">6.3. Derivative Works</h3>
 <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
 apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
 rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL",
 "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
 your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of
 the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public
 License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
 notice described in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> shall not of themselves be deemed to
 be modifications of this License.)
 <h2 id="section-7">7. <strong class="very-strong">Disclaimer of warranty</strong></h2>
 <p><strong class="very-strong">Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is"
  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without
  limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
  the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you
  (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary
  servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part
  of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this
  disclaimer.</strong>
 <h2 id="section-8">8. Termination</h2>
 <p id="section-8.1">8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
  within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
 <p id="section-8.2">8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
  claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor
  (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to
  as "Participant") alleging that:
 <ol type="a">
  <li id="section-8.2-a">such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
   Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and/or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> of this
   License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
   within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
   Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
   Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
   respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
   notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
   writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
   Participant to You under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and/or
   <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
   notice period specified above.
  <li id="section-8.2-b">any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
   Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights
   granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(<a href="#section-2.1-b">b</a>)
   and 2.2(<a href="#section-2.2-b">b</a>) are revoked effective as of the date You first
   made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
 </ol>
 <p id="section-8.3">8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
  alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
  initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
  granted by such Participant under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> or
  <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> shall be taken into account in determining the amount or
  value of any payment or license.
 <p id="section-8.4">8.4. In the event of termination under Sections
  <a href="#section-8.1">8.1</a> or <a href="#section-8.2">8.2</a> above, all end user
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
  granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
  termination.
 <h2 id="section-9">9. <strong class="very-strong">Limitation of liability</strong></h2>
 <p><strong class="very-strong">Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether
  tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer,
  any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of
  such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or
  consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss
  of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
  commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
  possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability
  for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
  applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
  or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation
  may not apply to you.</strong>
 <h2 id="section-10">10. <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> government end users</h2>
 <p>The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
  <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 2.101 (<abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 1995), consisting of
  "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
  terms are used in 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 12.212 (<abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr>
  1995). Consistent with 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 12.212 and 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr>
  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all <abbr>U.S.</abbr> Government End Users
  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
 <h2 id="section-11">11. Miscellaneous</h2>
 <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If
  any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
  governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
  provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
  disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
  registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
  Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
  with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court
  costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United
  Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
 <h2 id="section-12">12. Responsibility for claims</h2>
 <p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
  claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
  under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
  distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 <h2 id="section-13">13. Multiple-licensed code</h2>
 <p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
  "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits
  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the <abbr>MPL</abbr>
