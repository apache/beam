 * This class provides an expensive sleeper to deal with issues around Java's
 * accuracy of {@link System#currentTimeMillis} and methods such as
 * {@link Object#wait} and {@link Thread#sleep} which depend on it. This <a
 * href="https://blogs.oracle.com/dholmes/entry/inside_the_hotspot_vm_clocks">
 * article</a> goes into further detail about this issue.
 *
 * <p>This {@link Sleeper} uses {@link System#nanoTime}
 * as the timing source and {@link LockSupport#parkNanos} as the wait method.
 * Note that usage of this sleeper may impact performance because
 * of the relatively more expensive methods being invoked when compared to
 * {@link Thread#sleep}.
