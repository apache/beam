/**
 * Signifies that a public API (public class, method or field) is subject to
 * incompatible changes, or even removal, in a future release. An API bearing
 * this annotation is exempt from any compatibility guarantees made by its
 * containing library. Note that the presence of this annotation implies nothing
 * about the quality or performance of the API in question, only the fact that
 * it is not "API-frozen."
 *
 * <p>It is generally safe for <i>applications</i> to depend on experimental
 * APIs, at the cost of some extra work during upgrades. However, it is
 * generally inadvisable for <i>libraries</i> (which get included on users'
 * class paths, outside the library developers' control) to do so.
