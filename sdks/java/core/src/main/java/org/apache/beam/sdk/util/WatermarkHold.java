   * Add a hold to prevent the output watermark progressing beyond the (possibly adjusted) timestamp

   * remain until cleared by {@link #extractAndRelease}. Return the timestamp at which the hold
   * was placed, or {@literal null} if no hold was placed.
   *
   * <p>In the following we'll write {@code E} to represent an element's timestamp after passing
   * through the window strategy's output time function, {@code IWM} for the local input watermark,
   * {@code OWM} for the local output watermark, and {@code GCWM} for the garbage collection
   * watermark (which is at {@code IWM - getAllowedLateness}). Time progresses from left to right,
   * and we write {@code [ ... ]} to denote a bounded window with implied lower bound.
   *
   * <p>Note that the GCWM will be the same as the IWM if {@code getAllowedLateness}
   * is {@code ZERO}.
   *
   * <p>Here are the cases we need to handle. They are conceptually considered in the
   * sequence written since if getAllowedLateness is ZERO the GCWM is the same as the IWM.
   * <ol>
   * <li>(Normal)
   * <pre>
   *          |
   *      [   | E        ]
   *          |
   *         IWM
   * </pre>
   * This is, hopefully, the common and happy case. The element is locally on-time and can
   * definitely make it to an {@code ON_TIME} pane which we can still set an end-of-window timer
   * for. We place an element hold at E, which may contribute to the {@code ON_TIME} pane's
   * timestamp (depending on the output time function). Thus the OWM will not proceed past E
   * until the next pane fires.
   *
   * <li>(Discard - no target window)
   * <pre>
   *                       |                            |
   *      [     E        ] |                            |
   *                       |                            |
   *                     GCWM  <-getAllowedLateness->  IWM
   * </pre>
   * The element is very locally late. The window has been garbage collected, thus there
   * is no target pane E could be assigned to. We discard E.
   *
   * <li>(Unobservably late)
   * <pre>
   *          |    |
   *      [   | E  |     ]
   *          |    |
   *         OWM  IWM
   * </pre>
   * The element is locally late, however we can still treat this case as for 'Normal' above
   * since the IWM has not yet passed the end of the window and the element is ahead of the
   * OWM. In effect, we get to 'launder' the locally late element and consider it as locally
   * on-time because no downstream computation can observe the difference.
   *
   * <li>(Maybe late 1)
   * <pre>
   *          |            |
   *      [   | E        ] |
   *          |            |
   *         OWM          IWM
   * </pre>
   * The end-of-window timer may have already fired for this window, and thus an {@code ON_TIME}
   * pane may have already been emitted. However, if timer firings have been delayed then it
   * is possible the {@code ON_TIME} pane has not yet been emitted. We can't place an element
   * hold since we can't be sure if it will be cleared promptly. Thus this element *may* find
   * its way into an {@code ON_TIME} pane, but if so it will *not* contribute to that pane's
   * timestamp. We may however set a garbage collection hold if required.
   *
   * <li>(Maybe late 2)
   * <pre>
   *               |   |
   *      [     E  |   | ]
   *               |   |
   *              OWM IWM
   * </pre>
   * The end-of-window timer has not yet fired, so this element may still appear in an
   * {@code ON_TIME} pane. However the element is too late to contribute to the output
   * watermark hold, and thus won't contribute to the pane's timestamp. We can still place an
   * end-of-window hold.
   *
   * <li>(Maybe late 3)
   * <pre>
   *               |       |
   *      [     E  |     ] |
   *               |       |
   *              OWM     IWM
   * </pre>
   * As for the (Maybe late 2) case, however we don't even know if the end-of-window timer
   * has already fired, or it is about to fire. We can place only the garbage collection hold,
   * if required.
   *
   * <li>(Definitely late)
   * <pre>
   *                       |   |
   *      [     E        ] |   |
   *                       |   |
   *                      OWM IWM
   * </pre>
   * The element is definitely too late to make an {@code ON_TIME} pane. We are too late to
   * place an end-of-window hold. We can still place a garbage collection hold if required.
   *
   * </ol>
