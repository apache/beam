 * An identifier which represents a file-like resource.

 * <p>{@link ResourceId} is hierarchical and composed of a sequence of directory
 * and file name elements separated by a special separator or delimiter.
 *
 * <p>{@link ResourceId ResourceIds} are created using {@link FileSystems}. The two primary
 * mechanisms are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link FileSystems#match(java.util.List)}, which takes a list of {@link String} resource
 *   names or globs, queries the {@link FileSystem} for resources matching these specifications,
 *   and returns a {@link MatchResult} for each glob. This is typically used when reading from
 *   files.
 *
 *   <li>{@link FileSystems#matchNewResource(String, boolean)}, which takes a {@link String} full
 *   resource name and type (file or directory) and generates a {@link FileSystem}-specific
 *   {@code ResourceId} for that resource. This call does not verify the presence or absence of that
 *   resource in the file system. This call is typically used when creating new directories or files
 *   to generate {@link ResourceId ResourceIds} for resources that may not yet exist.
