/**
 * Provides an efficient encoding for {@link Iterable}s containing small values by
 * buffering up to {@code bufferSize} bytes of data before prefixing the count.
 * Note that each element needs to be encoded in a nested context. See
 * {@link Context Coder.Context} for more details.
 *
 * <p>To use this stream:
 * <pre><code>
 * BufferedElementCountingOutputStream os = ...
 * for (Element E : elements) {
 *   os.markElementStart();
 *   // write an element to os
 * }
 * os.finish();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>The resulting output stream is:
 * <pre>
 * countA element(0) element(1) ... element(countA - 1)
 * countB element(0) element(1) ... element(countB - 1)
 * ...
 * countX element(0) element(1) ... element(countX - 1)
 * countY
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>To read this stream:
 * <pre>{@code
 * InputStream is = ...
 * long count;
 * do {
 *   count = VarInt.decodeLong(is);
 *   for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
 *     // read an element from is
 *   }
 * } while(count > 0);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The counts are encoded as variable length longs. See {@link VarInt#encode(long, OutputStream)}
 * for more details. The end of the iterable is detected by reading a count of 0.
