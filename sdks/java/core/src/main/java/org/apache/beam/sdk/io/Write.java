/**
 * A {@link PTransform} that writes to a {@link Sink}. A write begins with a sequential global
 * initialization of a sink, followed by a parallel write, and ends with a sequential finalization
 * of the write. The output of a write is {@link PDone}.
 *
 * <p>By default, every bundle in the input {@link PCollection} will be processed by a
 * {@link WriteOperation}, so the number of outputs will vary based on runner behavior, though at
 * least 1 output will always be produced. The exact parallelism of the write stage can be
 * controlled using {@link Write.Bound#withNumShards}, typically used to control how many files are
 * produced or to globally limit the number of workers connecting to an external service. However,
 * this option can often hurt performance: it adds an additional {@link GroupByKey} to the pipeline.
 *
 * <p>{@code Write} re-windows the data into the global window, so it is typically not well suited
 * to use in streaming pipelines.
 *
 * <p>Example usage with runner-controlled sharding:
 *
 * <pre>{@code p.apply(Write.to(new MySink(...)));}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Example usage with a fixed number of shards:
 *
 * <pre>{@code p.apply(Write.to(new MySink(...)).withNumShards(3));}</pre>
