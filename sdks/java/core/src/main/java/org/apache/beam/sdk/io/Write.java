     * containing the WriteOperation.

     * <p>This singleton collection containing the WriteOperation is then used as a side input to a
     * ParDo over the PCollection of elements to write. In this bundle-writing phase,
     * {@link WriteOperation#createWriter} is called to obtain a {@link Writer}.
     * {@link Writer#open} and {@link Writer#close} are called in {@link DoFn#startBundle} and
     * {@link DoFn#finishBundle}, respectively, and {@link Writer#write} method is called for every
     * element in the bundle. The output of this ParDo is a PCollection of <i>writer result</i>
     * objects (see {@link Sink} for a description of writer results)-one for each bundle.
     *
     * <p>The final do-once ParDo uses the singleton collection of the WriteOperation as input and
     * the collection of writer results as a side-input. In this ParDo,
     * {@link WriteOperation#finalize} is called to finalize the write.
     *
     * <p>If the write of any element in the PCollection fails, {@link Writer#close} will be called
     * before the exception that caused the write to fail is propagated and the write result will be
     * discarded.
     *
     * <p>Since the {@link WriteOperation} is serialized after the initialization ParDo and
     * deserialized in the bundle-writing and finalization phases, any state change to the
     * WriteOperation object that occurs during initialization is visible in the latter phases.
     * However, the WriteOperation is not serialized after the bundle-writing phase.  This is why
     * implementations should guarantee that {@link WriteOperation#createWriter} does not mutate
     * WriteOperation).
