   * Query for all metric values that match a given filter.
   *
   * <p>The {@code filter} may filter based on the namespace and/or name of the metric, as well as
   * the step that reported the metric.
   *
   * <p>For each type of metric, the result contains an iterable of all metrics of that type that
   * matched the filter. Each {@link MetricResult} includes the name of the metric, the step in
   * which it was reported and the {@link MetricResult#committed} and
   * {@link MetricResult#attempted} values.
   *
   * <p>Note that runners differ in their support for committed and attempted values.
   *
   * <p>Example: Querying the metrics reported from the {@code SomeDoFn} example in {@link Metrics}
   * could be done as follows:
   * <pre>{@code
   * Pipeline p = ...;
   * p.apply("create1", Create.of("hello")).apply("myStepName1", ParDo.of(new SomeDoFn()));
   * p.apply("create2", Create.of("world")).apply("myStepName2", ParDo.of(new SomeDoFn()));
   * PipelineResult result = p.run();
   * MetricResults metrics = result.metrics();
   * MetricQueryResults metricResults = metrics.queryMetrics(new MetricsFilter.Builder()
   *     .addNameFilter("my-counter")
   *     .addStepFilter("myStepName1").addStepFilter("myStepName2")
   *     .build());
   * Iterable<MetricResult<Long>> counters = metricResults.counters();
   * // counters should contain the value of my-counter reported from each of the ParDo
   * // applications.
   * }</pre>
