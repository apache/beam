 * <p>A function to adapt a primitive "view" of a {@link PCollection} - some materialization
 * specified in the Beam model and implemented by the runner - to a user-facing view type
 * for side input.
 *
 * <p>Both the underlying primitive view and the user-facing view are immutable.
 *
 * <p>The most common case is using the {@link View} transforms to prepare a {@link PCollection}
 * for use as a side input to {@link ParDo}. See {@link View#asSingleton()},
 * {@link View#asIterable()}, and {@link View#asMap()} for more detail on specific views
 * available in the SDK.

 * @param <PrimitiveViewT> the type of the underlying primitive view required
 * @param <ViewT> the type of the value(s) accessible via this {@link PCollectionView}
