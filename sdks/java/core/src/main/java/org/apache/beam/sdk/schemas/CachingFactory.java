/**
 * A wrapper around a {@link Factory} that assumes the schema parameter never changes.
 *
 * <p>{@link Factory} objects take the schema as a parameter, as often the returned type varies by
 * schema (e.g. sometimes the returned-type is a list that must be in schema-field order). However
 * in many cases it's known by the caller that the schema parameter is always the same across all
 * calls to create. In these cases we want to save the cost of Schema comparison (which can be
 * significant for larger schemas) on each lookup. This wrapper caches the value returned by the
 * inner factory, so the schema comparison only need happen on the first lookup.
