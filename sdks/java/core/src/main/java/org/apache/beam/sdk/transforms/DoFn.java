/**
 * The argument to {@link ParDo} providing the code to use to process elements of the input {@link
 * org.apache.beam.sdk.values.PCollection}.
 *
 * <p>See {@link ParDo} for more explanation, examples of use, and discussion of constraints on
 * {@code DoFn}s, including their serializability, lack of access to global shared mutable state,
 * requirements for failure tolerance, and benefits of optimization.
 *
 * <p>{@link DoFn DoFns} can be tested by using {@link TestPipeline}. You can verify their
 * functional correctness in a local test using the {@code DirectRunner} as well as running
 * integration tests with your production runner of choice. Typically, you can generate the input
 * data using {@link Create#of} or other transforms. However, if you need to test the behavior of
 * {@link StartBundle} and {@link FinishBundle} with particular bundle boundaries, you can use
 * {@link TestStream}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must define a method annotated with {@link ProcessElement} that satisfies the
 * requirements described there. See the {@link ProcessElement} for details.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal PCollection<String>} lines = ... ;
 * {@literal PCollection<String>} words =
 *     {@literal lines.apply(ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>())} {
 *         {@literal @ProcessElement}
 *          public void processElement({@literal @}Element String element, BoundedWindow window) {

   * <p>See <a href="https://s.apache.org/splittable-do-fn">the proposal</a> for an overview of the
   * involved concepts (<i>splittable DoFn</i>, <i>restriction</i>, <i>restriction tracker</i>).
   *
   * <p>If a {@link DoFn} is splittable, the following constraints must be respected:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>It <i>must</i> define a {@link GetInitialRestriction} method.
   *   <li>It <i>may</i> define a {@link GetSize} method.
   *   <li>It <i>may</i> define a {@link SplitRestriction} method.
   *   <li>It <i>may</i> define a {@link NewTracker} method returning a subtype of {@code
   *       RestrictionTracker<R>} where {@code R} is the restriction type returned by {@link
   *       GetInitialRestriction}. This method is optional in case the restriction type returned by
   *       {@link GetInitialRestriction} implements {@link HasDefaultTracker}.
   *   <li>It <i>may</i> define a {@link GetRestrictionCoder} method.
   *   <li>The type of restrictions used by all of these methods must be the same.
   *   <li>Its {@link ProcessElement} method <i>may</i> return a {@link ProcessContinuation} to
   *       indicate whether there is more work to be done for the current element.
   *   <li>Its {@link ProcessElement} method <i>must not</i> use any extra context parameters, such
   *       as {@link BoundedWindow}.
   *   <li>The {@link DoFn} itself <i>may</i> be annotated with {@link BoundedPerElement} or {@link
   *       UnboundedPerElement}, but not both at the same time. If it's not annotated with either of
   *       these, it's assumed to be {@link BoundedPerElement} if its {@link ProcessElement} method
   *       returns {@code void} and {@link UnboundedPerElement} if it returns a {@link
   *       ProcessContinuation}.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>A non-splittable {@link DoFn} <i>must not</i> define any of these methods.
