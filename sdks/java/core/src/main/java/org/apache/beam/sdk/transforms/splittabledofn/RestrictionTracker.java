     *   <li>Pull based queue based source (e.g. Pubsub): The local/global size available in number
     *       of messages or number of {@code message bytes} that have processed and the number of
     *       messages or number of {@code message bytes} that are outstanding.
     *   <li>Key range based source (e.g. BigQuery, Bigtable, ...): Scale the start key to be one
