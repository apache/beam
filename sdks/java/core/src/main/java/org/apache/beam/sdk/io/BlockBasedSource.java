/**
 * A {@code BlockBasedSource} is a {@link FileBasedSource} where a file consists of blocks of
 * records.
 *
 * <p>{@code BlockBasedSource} should be derived from when a file format does not support efficient
 * seeking to a record in the file, but can support efficient seeking to a block. Alternatively,
 * records in the file cannot be offset-addressed, but blocks can (it is not possible to say
 * that record {code i} starts at offset {@code m}, but it is possible to say that block {@code j}
 *  starts at offset {@code n}).
 *
 * <p>The records that will be read from a {@code BlockBasedSource} that corresponds to a subrange
 * of a file {@code [startOffset, endOffset)} are those records such that the record is contained in
 * a block that starts at offset {@code i}, where {@code i >= startOffset} and
 * {@code i < endOffset}. In other words, a record will be read from the source if its first byte is
 * contained in a block that begins within the range described by the source.
 *
 * <p>This entails that it is possible to determine the start offsets of all blocks in a file.
 *
 * <p>Progress reporting for reading from a {@code BlockBasedSource} is inaccurate. A {@link
 * BlockBasedReader} reports its current offset as {@code (offset of current block) + (current block
 * size) * (fraction of block consumed)}. However, only the offset of the current block is required
 * to be accurately reported by subclass implementations. As such, in the worst case, the current
 * offset is only updated at block boundaries.
 *
 * <p>{@code BlockBasedSource} supports dynamic splitting. However, because records in a {@code
 * BlockBasedSource} are not required to have offsets and progress reporting is inaccurate, {@code
 * BlockBasedReader} only supports splitting at block boundaries.
 * In other words, {@link BlockBasedReader#atSplitPoint} returns true iff the current record is the
 * first record in a block. See {@link FileBasedSource.FileBasedReader} for discussion about split
 * points.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of records to be read from the source.
