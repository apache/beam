/**
 * Delays processing of each window in a {@link PCollection} until signaled.
 *
 * <p>Given a main {@link PCollection} and a signal {@link PCollection}, produces output identical
 * to its main input, but all elements for a window are produced only once that window is closed
 * in the signal {@link PCollection}.
 *
 * <p>To express the pattern "apply T to X after Y is ready", use {@code
 * X.apply(Wait.on(Y)).apply(T)}.
 *
 * <p>In particular: returns a {@link PCollection} with contents identical to the input, but delays
 * producing elements of the output in window W until the signal's window W closes (i.e. signal's
 * watermark passes W.end + signal.allowedLateness).
 *
 * <p>In other words, an element of the output at timestamp "t" will be produced only after no more
 * elements of the signal can appear with a timestamp below "t".
 *
 * <p>Example usage: write a {@link PCollection} to one database and then to another database,
 * making sure that writing a window of data to the second database starts only after the respective
 * window has been fully written to the first database.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * PCollection<Void> firstWriteResults = data.apply(ParDo.of(...write to first database...));
 * data.apply(Wait.on(firstWriteResults))
 *     // Windows of this intermediate PCollection will be processed no earlier than when
 *     // the respective window of firstWriteResults closes.
 *     .apply(ParDo.of(...write to second database...));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Notes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If signal is globally windowed, main input must also be. This typically would be useful
 *       only in a batch pipeline, because the global window of an infinite PCollection never
 *       closes, so the wait signal will never be ready.
 *   <li>Beware that if the signal has large allowed lateness, the wait signal will fire only after
 *       that lateness elapses, i.e. after the watermark of the signal passes end of the window plus
 *       allowed lateness. In other words: do not use this with signals that specify a large allowed
 *       lateness.
 * </ul>
