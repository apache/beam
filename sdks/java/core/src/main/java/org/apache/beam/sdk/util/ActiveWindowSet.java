/**
 * Track which windows are <i>active</i>, and the <i>state address window(s)</i> under which their
 * state is stored. Also help with the multi-step process of merging windows and their associated
 * state.
 *
 * <p>When windows are merged we must also merge their state. For example, we may need to
 * concatenate buffered elements, sum a count of elements, or find a new minimum timestamp.
 * If we start with two windows {@code Wa} and {@code Wb} and later discover they should be
 * merged into window {@code Wab} then, naively, we must copy and merge the states of {@code Wa}
 * and {@code Wab} into {@code Wab}.
 *
 * <p>However, the common case for merging windows is for a new window to be merged into an
 * existing window. Thus, if {@code Wa} is the existing window and {@code Wb} the new window it
 * is more efficient to leave the state for {@code Wa} where it is, and simply redirect {@code
 * Wab} to it. In this case we say {@code Wab} has a state address window of {@code Wa}.
 *
 * <p>Even if windows {@code Wa} and {@code Wb} already have state, it can still be more efficient
 * to append the state of {@code Wb} onto {@code Wa} rather than copy the state from {@code Wa}
 * and {@code Wb} into {@code Wab}.
 *
 * <p>We use the following terminology for windows:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>ACTIVE</b>: A window that has state associated with it and has not itself been merged
 * away. The window may have one (or more) state address windows under which its
 * non-empty state is stored. A state value for an ACTIVE window must be derived by reading
 * the state in (all of) its state address windows. Note that only pre 1.4 pipelines
 * use multiple state address windows per active window. From 1.4 onwards we eagerly merge
 * window state into a single state address window.
 * <li><b>NEW</b>: The initial state for a window of an incoming element which is not
 * already ACTIVE. We have not yet called {@link WindowFn#mergeWindows}, and so don't yet know
 * whether the window will be be merged into another NEW or ACTIVE window, or will
 * become an ACTIVE window in its own right.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>If no windows will ever be merged we can use the trivial implementation {@link
 * NonMergingActiveWindowSet}. Otherwise, the actual implementation of this data structure is in
 * {@link MergingActiveWindowSet}.
 *
 * @param <W> the type of window being managed
