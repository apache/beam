 * An abstraction to create schema capable and aware IOs. The interface is intended to be used in
 * conjunction with the interface {@link SchemaIOProvider}.
 *
 * <p>The interfaces can be implemented to make IOs available in other SDKs in addition to Beam SQL.
 *
 * <p><b>Internal only:</b> This interface is actively being worked on and it will likely change as
 * we provide implementations for more standard Beam IOs. We provide no backwards compatibility
 * guarantees and it should not be implemented outside of the Beam repository.
