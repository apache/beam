/**
 * Triggers control when the elements for a specific key and window are output. As
 * elements arrive, they are put into one or more windows by a {@link Window} transform and its
 * associated {@link WindowFn}, and then passed to the associated {@link Trigger} to determine if
 * the {@link BoundedWindow Window's} contents should be output.
 *
 * <p>See {@link GroupByKey} and {@link Window} for more information about how grouping with windows
 * works.
 *
 * <p>The elements that are assigned to a window since the last time it was fired (or since the
 * window was created) are placed into the current window pane. Triggers are evaluated against the
 * elements as they are added. When the root trigger fires, the elements in the current pane will be
 * output. When the root trigger finishes (indicating it will never fire again), the window is
 * closed and any new elements assigned to that window are discarded.
 *
 * <p>Several predefined triggers are provided:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link AfterWatermark} for firing when the watermark passes a timestamp determined from
 *     either the end of the window or the arrival of the first element in a pane.
 * <li> {@link AfterProcessingTime} for firing after some amount of processing time has elapsed
 *     (typically since the first element in a pane).
 * <li> {@link AfterPane} for firing off a property of the elements in the current pane, such as the
 *     number of elements that have been assigned to the current pane.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition, triggers can be combined in a variety of ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link Repeatedly#forever} to create a trigger that executes forever. Any time its argument
 *     finishes it gets reset and starts over. Can be combined with {@link Trigger#orFinally} to
 *     specify a condition that causes the repetition to stop.
 * <li> {@link AfterEach#inOrder} to execute each trigger in sequence, firing each (and every) time
 *     that a trigger fires, and advancing to the next trigger in the sequence when it finishes.
 * <li> {@link AfterFirst#of} to create a trigger that fires after at least one of its arguments
 *     fires. An {@link AfterFirst} trigger finishes after it fires once.
 * <li> {@link AfterAll#of} to create a trigger that fires after all least one of its arguments have
 *     fired at least once. An {@link AfterAll} trigger finishes after it fires once.
 * </ul>
