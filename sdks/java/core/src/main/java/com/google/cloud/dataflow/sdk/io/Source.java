/**
 * Base class for defining input formats and creating a {@code Source} for reading the input.
 *
 * <p>This class is not intended to be subclassed directly. Instead, to define
 * a bounded source (a source which produces a finite amount of input), subclass
 * {@link BoundedSource}; to define an unbounded source, subclass {@link UnboundedSource}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code Source} passed to a {@code Read} transform must be
 * {@code Serializable}.  This allows the {@code Source} instance
 * created in this "main program" to be sent (in serialized form) to
 * remote worker machines and reconstituted for each batch of elements
 * of the input {@code PCollection} being processed or for each source splitting
 * operation. A {@code Source} can have instance variable state, and
 * non-transient instance variable state will be serialized in the main program
 * and then deserialized on remote worker machines.
 *
 * <p>{@code Source} classes MUST be effectively immutable. The only acceptable use of
 * mutable fields is to cache the results of expensive operations, and such fields MUST be
 * marked {@code transient}.
 *
 * <p>{@code Source} objects should override {@link Object#toString}, as it will be
 * used in important error and debugging messages.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of elements read by the source.

   * The interface that readers of custom input sources must implement.
   *
   * <p>This interface is deliberately distinct from {@link java.util.Iterator} because
   * the current model tends to be easier to program and more efficient in practice
   * for iterating over sources such as files, databases etc. (rather than pure collections).
   *
   * <p>Reading data from the {@link Reader} must obey the following access pattern:
   * <ul>
   * <li> One call to {@link #start}
   * <ul><li>If {@link #start} returned true, any number of calls to {@code getCurrent}*
   *   methods</ul>
   * <li> Repeatedly, a call to {@link #advance}. This may be called regardless
   *   of what the previous {@link #start}/{@link #advance} returned.
   * <ul><li>If {@link #advance} returned true, any number of calls to {@code getCurrent}*
   *   methods</ul>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>For example, if the reader is reading a fixed set of data:
   * <pre>
   *   try {
   *     for (boolean available = reader.start(); available; available = reader.advance()) {
   *       T item = reader.getCurrent();
   *       Instant timestamp = reader.getCurrentTimestamp();
   *       ...
   *     }
   *   } finally {
   *     reader.close();
   *   }
   * </pre>
   *
   * <p>If the set of data being read is continually growing:
   * <pre>
   *   try {
   *     boolean available = reader.start();
   *     while (true) {
   *       if (available) {
   *         T item = reader.getCurrent();
   *         Instant timestamp = reader.getCurrentTimestamp();
   *         ...
   *         resetExponentialBackoff();
   *       } else {
   *         exponentialBackoff();
   *       }
   *       available = reader.advance();
   *     }
   *   } finally {
   *     reader.close();
   *   }
   * </pre>
   *
   * <p>Note: this interface is a work-in-progress and may change.
   *
   * <p>All {@code Reader} functions except {@link #getCurrentSource} do not need to be thread-safe;
   * they may only be accessed by a single thread at once. However, {@link #getCurrentSource} needs
   * to be thread-safe, and other functions should assume that its returned value can change
   * asynchronously.
