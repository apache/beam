/**
 * Provides a simple, powerful model for building both batch and

 * {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.Pipeline}s.
 *
 * <p>To use the Google Cloud Dataflow SDK, you build a
 * {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.Pipeline}, which manages a graph of
 * {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.transforms.PTransform}s
 * and the {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.values.PCollection}s that
 * the PTransforms consume and produce.
 *
 * <p>Each Pipeline has a
 * {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.runners.PipelineRunner} to specify
 * where and how it should run after pipeline construction is complete.
