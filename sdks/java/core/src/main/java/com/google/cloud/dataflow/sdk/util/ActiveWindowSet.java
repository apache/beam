/**
 * Track which active windows have their state associated with merged-away windows.
 *
 * When windows are merged we must track which state previously associated with the merged windows
 * must now be associated with the result window. Some of that state may be combined eagerly when
 * the windows are merged. The rest is combined lazily when the final state is actually
 * required when emitting a pane. We keep track of this using an {@link ActiveWindowSet}.
 *
 * <p>An {@link ActiveWindowSet} considers a window to be in one of the following states:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>NEW</b>: The initial state for a window on an incoming element; we do not yet know
 *       if it should be merged into an ACTIVE window, or whether it is already present as an
 *       ACTIVE window, since we have not yet called
 *       {@link WindowFn#mergeWindows}.</li>
 *   <li><b>ACTIVE</b>: A window that has state associated with it and has not itself been merged
 *       away. The window may have one or more <i>state address</i> windows under which its
 *       non-empty state is stored. A state value for an ACTIVE window must be derived by reading
 *       the state in all of its state address windows.</li>
 *   <li><b>EPHEMERAL</b>: A NEW window that has been merged into an ACTIVE window before any state
 *       has been associated with that window. Thus the window is neither ACTIVE nor MERGED. These
 *       windows are not persistently represented since if they reappear the merge function should
 *       again redirect them to an ACTIVE window. EPHEMERAL windows are an optimization for
 *       the common case of in-order events and {@link Sessions session window} by never associating
 *       state with windows that are created and immediately merged away.</li>
 *   <li><b>MERGED</b>: An ACTIVE window has been merged into another ACTIVE window after it had
 *       state associated with it. The window will thus appear as a state address window for exactly
 *       one ACTIVE window.</li>
 *   <li><b>EXPIRED</b>: The window has expired and may have been garbage collected. No new elements
 *       (even late elements) will ever be assigned to that window. These windows are not explicitly
 *       represented anywhere; it is expected that the user of {@link ActiveWindowSet} will store
 *       no state associated with the window.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>If no windows will ever be merged we can use the trivial implementation {@link
 * NonMergingActiveWindowSet}. Otherwise, the actual implementation of this data structure is in
 * {@link MergingActiveWindowSet}.
 *
 * @param <W> the type of window being managed
