   * <p>Once {@link #start} or {@link #advance} has returned false, neither will be called
   * again on this object.
   *
   * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
   * All methods will be run from the same thread except {@link #splitAtFraction},
   * {@link #getFractionConsumed} and {@link #getCurrentSource}, which can be called concurrently
   * from a different thread. There will not be multiple concurrent calls to
   * {@link #splitAtFraction} but there can be for {@link #getFractionConsumed} if
   * {@link #splitAtFraction} is implemented.
   *
   * <p>If the source does not implement {@link #splitAtFraction}, you do not need to worry about
   * thread safety. If implemented, it must be safe to call {@link #splitAtFraction} and
   * {@link #getFractionConsumed} concurrently with other methods.
   *
   * <p>Additionally, a successful {@link #splitAtFraction} call must, by definition, cause
   * {@link #getCurrentSource} to start returning a different value.
   * Callers of {@link #getCurrentSource} need to be aware of the possibility that the returned
   * value can change at any time, and must only access the properties of the source returned by
   * {@link #getCurrentSource} which do not change between {@link #splitAtFraction} calls.
   *
   * <h3>Implementing {@link #splitAtFraction}</h3>
   * In the course of dynamic work rebalancing, the method {@link #splitAtFraction}
   * may be called concurrently with {@link #advance} or {@link #start}. It is critical that
   * their interaction is implemented in a thread-safe way, otherwise data loss is possible.
   *
   * <p>Sources which support dynamic work rebalancing should use
   * {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.io.range.RangeTracker} to manage the (source-specific)
   * range of positions that is being split. If your source supports dynamic work rebalancing,
   * please use that class to implement it if possible; if not possible, please contact the team
   * at <i>dataflow-feedback@google.com</i>.

    /**
     * Returns a {@code Source} describing the same input that this {@code Reader} currently reads

     *
     * <h3>Usage</h3>
     * <p>Reader subclasses can use this method for convenience to access unchanging properties of
     * the source being read. Alternatively, they can cache these properties in the constructor.
     * <p>The framework will call this method in the course of dynamic work rebalancing, e.g. after
     * a successful {@link BoundedSource.BoundedReader#splitAtFraction} call.
     *
     * <h3>Mutability and thread safety</h3>
     * Remember that {@link Source} objects must always be immutable. However, the return value of
     * this function may be affected by dynamic work rebalancing, happening asynchronously via
     * {@link BoundedSource.BoundedReader#splitAtFraction}, meaning it can return a different
     * {@link Source} object. However, the returned object itself will still itself be immutable.
     * Callers must take care not to rely on properties of the returned source that may be
     * asynchronously changed as a result of this process (e.g. do not cache an end offset when
     * reading a file).
     *
     * <h3>Implementation</h3>
     * For convenience, subclasses should usually return the most concrete subclass of
     * {@link Source} possible.
     * In practice, the implementation of this method should nearly always be one of the following:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Source that inherits from a base class that already implements
     *   {@link #getCurrentSource}: delegate to base class. In this case, it is almost always
     *   an error for the subclass to maintain its own copy of the source.
     * <pre>{@code
     *   public FooReader(FooSource<T> source) {
     *     super(source);
     *   }
     *
     *   public FooSource<T> getCurrentSource() {
     *     return (FooSource<T>)super.getCurrentSource();
     *   }
     * }</pre>
     *   <li>Source that does not support dynamic work rebalancing: return a private final variable.
     * <pre>{@code
     *   private final FooSource<T> source;
     *
     *   public FooReader(FooSource<T> source) {
     *     this.source = source;
     *   }
     *
     *   public FooSource<T> getCurrentSource() {
     *     return source;
     *   }
     * }</pre>
     *   <li>{@link BoundedSource.BoundedReader} that explicitly supports dynamic work rebalancing:
     *   maintain a variable pointing to an immutable source object, and protect it with
     *   synchronization.
     * <pre>{@code
     *   private FooSource<T> source;
     *
     *   public FooReader(FooSource<T> source) {
     *     this.source = source;
     *   }
     *
     *   public synchronized FooSource<T> getCurrentSource() {
     *     return source;
     *   }
     *
     *   public synchronized FooSource<T> splitAtFraction(double fraction) {
     *     ...
     *     FooSource<T> primary = ...;
     *     FooSource<T> residual = ...;
     *     this.source = primary;
     *     return residual;
     *   }
     * }</pre>
     * </ul>

    /**
     * Tells the reader to narrow the range of the input it's going to read and give up
     * the remainder, so that the new range would contain approximately the given
     * fraction of the amount of data in the current range.
     *
     * <p>Returns a {@code BoundedSource} representing the remainder.
     *
     * <h5>Detailed description</h5>
     * Assuming the following sequence of calls:
     * <pre>{@code
     *   BoundedSource<T> initial = reader.getCurrentSource();
     *   BoundedSource<T> residual = reader.splitAtFraction(fraction);
     *   BoundedSource<T> primary = reader.getCurrentSource();
     * }</pre>
     * <ul>
     *  <li> The "primary" and "residual" sources, when read, should together cover the same
     *  set of records as "initial".
     *  <li> The current reader should continue to be in a valid state, and continuing to read
     *  from it should, together with the records it already read, yield the same records
     *  as would have been read by "primary".
     *  <li> The amount of data read by "primary" should ideally represent approximately
     *  the given fraction of the amount of data read by "initial".
     * </ul>
     * For example, a reader that reads a range of offsets <i>[A, B)</i> in a file might implement
     * this method by truncating the current range to <i>[A, A + fraction*(B-A))</i> and returning
     * a Source representing the range <i>[A + fraction*(B-A), B)</i>.
     *
     * <p>This method should return {@code null} if the split cannot be performed for this fraction
     * while satisfying the semantics above. E.g., a reader that reads a range of offsets
     * in a file should return {@code null} if it is already past the position in its range
     * corresponding to the given fraction. In this case, the method MUST have no effect
     * (the reader must behave as if the method hadn't been called at all).
     *
     * <h5>Statefulness</h5>
     * Since this method (if successful) affects the reader's source, in subsequent invocations
     * "fraction" should be interpreted relative to the new current source.
     *
     * <h5>Thread safety and blocking</h5>
     * This method will be called concurrently to other methods (however there will not be multiple
     * concurrent invocations of this method itself), and it is critical for it to be implemented
     * in a thread-safe way (otherwise data loss is possible).
     *
     * <p>It is also very important that this method always completes quickly. In particular,
     * it should not perform or wait on any blocking operations such as I/O, RPCs etc. Violating
     * this requirement may stall completion of the work item or even cause it to fail.
     *
     * <p>It is incorrect to make both this method and {@link #start}/{@link #advance}
     * {@code synchronized}, because those methods can perform blocking operations, and then
     * this method would have to wait for those calls to complete.
     *
     * <p>{@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.io.range.RangeTracker} makes it easy to implement
     * this method safely and correctly.
     *
     * <p>By default, returns null to indicate that splitting is not possible.
