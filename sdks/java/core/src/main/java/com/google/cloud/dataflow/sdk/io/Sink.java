/**
 * A {@code Sink} represents a resource that can be written to using the {@link Write} transform.
 *
 * <p>A parallel write to a {@code Sink} consists of three phases:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A sequential <i>initialization</i> phase (e.g., creating a temporary output directory, etc.)
 * <li>A <i>parallel write</i> phase where workers write bundles of records
 * <li>A sequential <i>finalization</i> phase (e.g., committing the writes, merging output files,
 * etc.)
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Write} transform can be used in a Dataflow pipeline to perform this write.
 * Specifically, a Write transform can be applied to a {@link PCollection} {@code p} by:
 *
 * <p>{@code p.apply(Write.to(new MySink()));}
 *
 * <p>Implementing a {@link Sink} and the corresponding write operations requires extending three
 * abstract classes:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Sink}: an immutable logical description of the location/resource to write to.
 * Depending on the type of sink, it may contain fields such as the path to an output directory
 * on a filesystem, a database table name, etc. Implementors of {@link Sink} must
 * implement two methods: {@link Sink#validate} and {@link Sink#createWriteOperation}.
 * {@link Sink#validate Validate} is called by the Write transform at pipeline creation, and should
 * validate that the Sink can be written to. The createWriteOperation method is also called at
 * pipeline creation, and should return a WriteOperation object that defines how to write to the
 * Sink. Note that implementations of Sink must be serializable and Sinks must be immutable.
 *
 * <li>{@link WriteOperation}: The WriteOperation implements the <i>initialization</i> and
 * <i>finalization</i> phases of a write. Implementors of {@link WriteOperation} must implement
 * corresponding {@link WriteOperation#initialize} and {@link WriteOperation#finalize} methods. A
 * WriteOperation must also implement {@link WriteOperation#createWriter} that creates Writers,
 * {@link WriteOperation#getWriterResultCoder} that returns a {@link Coder} for the result of a
 * parallel write, and a {@link WriteOperation#getSink} that returns the Sink that the write
 * operation corresponds to. See below for more information about these methods and restrictions on
 * their implementation.
 *
 * <li>{@link Writer}: A Writer writes a bundle of records. Writer defines four methods:
 * {@link Writer#open}, which is called once at the start of writing a bundle; {@link Writer#write},
 * which writes a single record from the bundle; {@link Writer#close}, which is called once at the
 * end of writing a bundle; and {@link Writer#getWriteOperation}, which returns the write operation
 * that the writer belongs to.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>WriteOperation</h2>
 * <p>{@link WriteOperation#initialize} and {@link WriteOperation#finalize} are conceptually called
 * once: at the beginning and end of a Write transform. However, implementors must ensure that these
 * methods are idempotent, as they may be called multiple times on different machines in the case of
 * failure/retry or for redundancy.
 *
 * <p>The finalize method of WriteOperation is passed an Iterable of a writer result type. This
 * writer result type should encode the result of a write and, in most cases, some encoding of the
 * unique bundle id.
 *
 * <p>All implementations of {@link WriteOperation} must be serializable.
 *
 * <p>WriteOperation may have mutable state. For instance, {@link WriteOperation#initialize} may
 * mutate the object state. These mutations will be visible in {@link WriteOperation#createWriter}
 * and {@link WriteOperation#finalize} because the object will be serialized after initialize and
 * deserialized before these calls. However, it is not serialized again after createWriter is
 * called, as createWriter will be called within workers to create Writers for the bundles that are
 * distributed to these workers. Therefore, newWriter should not mutate the WriteOperation state (as
 * these mutations will not be visible in finalize).
 *
 * <h2>Bundle Ids:</h2>
 * <p>In order to ensure fault-tolerance, a bundle may be executed multiple times (e.g., in the
 * event of failure/retry or for redundancy). However, exactly one of these executions will have its
 * result passed to the WriteOperation's finalize method. Each call to {@link Writer#open} is passed
 * a unique <i>bundle id</i> when it is called by the Write transform, so even redundant or retried
 * bundles will have a unique way of identifying their output.
 *
 * <p>The bundle id should be used to guarantee that a bundle's output is unique. This uniqueness
 * guarantee is important; if a bundle is to be output to a file, for example, the name of the file
 * must be unique to avoid conflicts with other Writers. The bundle id should be encoded in the
 * writer result returned by the Writer and subsequently used by the WriteOperation's finalize
 * method to identify the results of successful writes.
 *
 * <p>For example, consider the scenario where a Writer writes files containing serialized records
 * and the WriteOperation's finalization step is to merge or rename these output files. In this
 * case, a Writer may use its unique id to name its output file (to avoid conflicts) and return the
 * name of the file it wrote as its writer result. The WriteOperation will then receive an Iterable
 * of output file names that it can then merge or rename using some bundle naming scheme.
 *
 * <h2>Writer Results:</h2>
 * <p>{@link WriteOperation}s and {@link Writer}s must agree on a writer result type that will be
 * returned by a Writer after it writes a bundle. This type can be a client-defined object or an
 * existing type; {@link WriteOperation#getWriterResultCoder} should return a {@link Coder} for the
 * type.
 *
 * <p>A note about thread safety: Any use of static members or methods in Writer should be thread
 * safe, as different instances of Writer objects may be created in different threads on the same
 * worker.
 *
 * @param <T> the type that will be written to the Sink.
