/**
 * {@code Window} logically divides up or groups the elements of a
 * {@link PCollection} into finite windows according to a {@link WindowFn}.
 * The output of {@code Window} contains the same elements as input, but they
 * have been logically assigned to windows. The next
 * {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.transforms.GroupByKey GroupByKeys},
 * including one within composite transforms, will group by the combination of
 * keys and windows.

 * <p>See {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.transforms.GroupByKey}
 * for more information about how grouping with windows works.
 *
 * <h2> Windowing </h2>
 *
 * <p>Windowing a {@code PCollection} divides the elements into windows based
 * on the associated event time for each element. This is especially useful
 * for {@code PCollection}s with unbounded size, since it allows operating on
 * a sub-group of the elements placed into a related window. For {@code PCollection}s
 * with a bounded size (aka. conventional batch mode), by default, all data is
 * implicitly in a single window, unless {@code Window} is applied.
 *
 * <p>For example, a simple form of windowing divides up the data into
 * fixed-width time intervals, using {@link FixedWindows}.
 * The following example demonstrates how to use {@code Window} in a pipeline
 * that counts the number of occurrences of strings each minute:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * PCollection<String> items = ...;
 * PCollection<String> windowed_items = items.apply(
 *   Window.<String>into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(1))));
 * PCollection<KV<String, Long>> windowed_counts = windowed_items.apply(
 *   Count.<String>perElement());
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p>Let (data, timestamp) denote a data element along with its timestamp.
 * Then, if the input to this pipeline consists of
 * {("foo", 15s), ("bar", 30s), ("foo", 45s), ("foo", 1m30s)},
 * the output will be
 * {(KV("foo", 2), 1m), (KV("bar", 1), 1m), (KV("foo", 1), 2m)}
 *
 * <p>Several predefined {@link WindowFn}s are provided:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> {@link FixedWindows} partitions the timestamps into fixed-width intervals.
 *  <li> {@link SlidingWindows} places data into overlapping fixed-width intervals.
 *  <li> {@link Sessions} groups data into sessions where each item in a window
 *       is separated from the next by no more than a specified gap.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Additionally, custom {@link WindowFn}s can be created, by creating new
 * subclasses of {@link WindowFn}.
 *
 * <h2> Triggers </h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Window.Bound#triggering(TriggerBuilder)} allows specifying a trigger to control when
 * (in processing time) results for the given window can be produced. If unspecified, the default
 * behavior is to trigger first when the watermark passes the end of the window, and then trigger
 * again every time there is late arriving data.
 *
 * <p>Elements are added to the current window pane as they arrive. When the root trigger fires,
 * output is produced based on the elements in the current pane.
 *
 * <p>Depending on the trigger, this can be used both to output partial results
 * early during the processing of the whole window, and to deal with late
 * arriving in batches.
 *
 * <p>Continuing the earlier example, if we wanted to emit the values that were available
 * when the watermark passed the end of the window, and then output any late arriving
 * elements once-per (actual hour) hour until we have finished processing the next 24-hours of data.
 * (The use of watermark time to stop processing tends to be more robust if the data source is slow
 * for a few days, etc.)
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * PCollection<String> items = ...;
 * PCollection<String> windowed_items = items.apply(
 *   Window.<String>into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))
 *      .triggering(
 *          AfterWatermark.pastEndOfWindow()
 *              .withLateFirings(AfterProcessingTime
 *                  .pastFirstElementInPane().plusDelayOf(Duration.standardHours(1))))
 *      .withAllowedLateness(Duration.standardDays(1)));
 * PCollection<KV<String, Long>> windowed_counts = windowed_items.apply(
 *   Count.<String>perElement());
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p>On the other hand, if we wanted to get early results every minute of processing
 * time (for which there were new elements in the given window) we could do the following:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * PCollection<String> windowed_items = items.apply(
 *   Window.<String>into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(1))
 *      .triggering(
 *      .triggering(
 *          AfterWatermark.pastEndOfWindow()
 *              .withEarlyFirings(AfterProcessingTime
 *                  .pastFirstElementInPane().plusDelayOf(Duration.standardMinutes(1))))
 *      .withAllowedLateness(Duration.ZERO));
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p>After a {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.transforms.GroupByKey} the trigger is set to
 * a trigger that will preserve the intent of the upstream trigger.  See
 * {@link Trigger#getContinuationTrigger} for more information.
 *
 * <p>See {@link Trigger} for details on the available triggers.
