// Package integration provides functionality that needs to be shared between all
// integration tests.
//
// Integration tests are implemented through Go's test framework, as test
// functions that create and execute pipelines using the ptest package. Tests
// should be placed in smaller sub-packages for organizational purposes and
// parallelism (tests are only run in parallel across different packages).
// Integration tests should always begin with a call to CheckFilters to ensure
// test filters can be applied, and each package containing integration tests
// should call ptest.Main in a TestMain function if it uses ptest.
//
// Running integration tests can be done with a go test call with any flags that
// are required by the test pipelines, such as --runner or --endpoint.
// Example:
//
//	go test -v ./sdks/go/test/integration/... --runner=portable --endpoint=localhost:8099
//
// Alternatively, tests can be executed by running the
// run_validatesrunner_tests.sh script, which also performs much of the
// environment setup, or by calling gradle commands in :sdks:go:test.
