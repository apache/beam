// Package postgresio provides native, high-performance Apache Beam I/O transforms
// for writing to PostgreSQL databases without Java Virtual Machine
// (JVM) dependencies.
//
// # Key Capabilities
//
// 1. Parameterized UNNEST Array Upserts: Executes high-throughput bulk inserts
// and idempotent upserts (INSERT INTO ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE) using vectorized
// array parameters, eliminating system catalog lock contention (pg_class, pg_attribute).
//
// Every pooled connection pins search_path to pg_catalog,pg_temp to close
// CVE-2018-1058, so an unqualified relation name cannot resolve to a user
// table. Table names must be given as schema.table; Write rejects an
// unqualified name when the pipeline is constructed rather than letting a
// worker fail later with "relation does not exist".
//
// 2. Deadlock Elimination (Anti-40P01): Employs an in-memory BatchCompactor that
// deduplicates micro-batches via Last-Write-Wins (LWW) and sorts records canonically
// by composite primary key prior to database transmission, preventing PostgreSQL
// SQLState 40P01 deadlocks across distributed workers.
//
// 3. Multi-Output Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ): Returns a WriteResult struct separating
// successfully committed records from rejected records (with sanitized error messages
// and SQL states), preventing credential disclosure in logs or queues.
