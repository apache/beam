// RegisterSchemaProvider allows pipeline authors to provide special handling
// to convert types to schema representations, when those types are used as
// fields in types being encoded as schema rows.
//
// At present, the only supported provider interface is SchemaProvider,
// though this may change in the future.
//
// Providers only need to support a limited set of types for conversion,
// specifically a single struct type or a pointer to struct type,
// or an interface type, which they are registered with.
//
// Providers have three tasks with respect to a given supported logical type:
//
//   * Producing schema representative types for their logical types.
//   * Producing schema encoders for values of that type, writing beam
//   schema encoded bytes for a value, matching the schema representative type.
//   * Producing schema decoders for values of that type, reading beam
//   schema encoded bytes, and producing a value of that type.
//
// Representative Schema types must be structs with only exported fields.
//
// A provider should be thread safe, but it's not required that a produced
// encoder or decoder is thread safe, since a separate encoder or decoder
// will be used for simultaneously executed bundles.
//
// If the supported type is an interface, that interface must have a non-empty
// method set. That is, it cannot be the empty interface.
//
// RegisterSchemaProvider must be called before beam.Init(), and conventionally
// is called in a package init() function.
