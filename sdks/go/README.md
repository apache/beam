# Go SDK Overview

The Apache Beam Go SDK is the Beam Model implemented in the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/).
It is based on the following initial [design](https://s.apache.org/beam-go-sdk-design-rfc).
Below describes requirements, how to run examples, execute tests, and contribute to the Go SDK.

_A note on Beam specific terminology used in this README._

_This README uses minimally necessary Beam related terminology to help you determine requirements, usage and 
contribution to the Go SDK. A [section](#definitions) provides short definitions for you to achieve these aims._

# Requirements

Aside from the obvious [go](https:/go.dev) installation on your local machine, below lists additional requirements
common to run examples, execute tests, and contribute to the Go SDK.

## Beam Repository

To keep terminal commands clear in this README, the following is assumed:

```
export BEAM_ROOT=path/to/where/you/clone/beam/repository
```

Only required to run examples, execute tests, and contribute to the Go SDK, [git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)
the Beam repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apache/beam.git $BEAM_ROOT
```

or if you [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the Beam repository into your GitHub
account with `<username>`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<username>/beam.git $BEAM_ROOT
```

## Java

You **do not** need to know or care about Java (or Python) to use the Go SDK for your data processing goals.

Java is **only** required to execute any [gradle](https://gradle.org/) commands configured in the
[Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam) repository. It will be obvious whether you will execute gradle commands in
sections below. You **do not** need to install [gradle](https://gradle.org/) and simply use the enclosed 
`$BEAM_ROOT/gradlew` executable available at the root of the [Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam) repository. 

## Docker

### Installation

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required for certain but not all runners [See definition](#runner).
MacOS developers may consider [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) as an alternative to Docker desktop.

### Special note for Colima users

[test/integration/internal/containers/containers.go](test/integration/internal/containers/containers.go)
relies on the use of the [test-containers](https://golang.testcontainers.org/) package where you may see
test execution errors such as
`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`

The following may help solve the error:

```
docker context use colima
export TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock
export DOCKER_HOST="unix://${HOME}/.colima/docker.sock"
```

See
[Important testcontainers Colima System Requirements](https://golang.testcontainers.org/system_requirements/using_colima)
for details.

# Run Examples

## Additional Requirements

In addition to the [common requirements](#requirements) listed above, the following lists anything additional for
running most of the [examples in this repository](examples).

### Google Cloud Setup

Most examples require Google Cloud related resources that serve as data [sources](#source) and [sinks](#sink).
Follow prerequisites listed as setup in https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/dataflow for the Java SDK
(It's optional to run the Java example for validation in that referenced documentation but not required).

## Usage

Running examples follows normal Go convention, parameterized by Go flags.

### 1. Navigate to the go.mod directory

Open a terminal and navigate into the go.mod containing directory of the Beam repository. (See above for what 
`$BEAM_ROOT` means). Notice that you are entering the `$BEAM_ROOT/sdks` and not `$BEAM_ROOT/sdks/go`.

```sh
cd $BEAM_ROOT/sdks
```

### 2. Execute

Per Go convention, execute an example as you would any `main` executable. Below illustrates how to execute the
[examples/wordcount](examples/wordcount) example on specific [Runners](#runner) and apply to all [examples](examples).

#### Run Example on Local Runner

To execute [examples/wordcount](examples/wordcount) on the Go [local runner](#local-runner):

```sh
cd $BEAM_ROOT/sdks
go run go/examples/wordcount/wordcount.go --output=/tmp/result.txt
```

You should see an output similar to:

```sh
[{6: KV<string,int>/GW/KV<bytes,int[varintz]>}]
[{10: KV<int,string>/GW/KV<int[varintz],bytes>}]
2018/03/21 09:39:03 Pipeline:
2018/03/21 09:39:03 Nodes: {1: []uint8/GW/bytes}

2: ParDo [In(Main): []uint8 <- {1: []uint8/GW/bytes}] -> [Out: T -> {2: string/GW/bytes}]
3: ParDo [In(Main): string <- {2: string/GW/bytes}] -> [Out: string -> {3: string/GW/bytes}]
4: ParDo [In(Main): string <- {3: string/GW/bytes}] -> [Out: string -> {4: string/GW/bytes}]

8: Combine [In(Main): int <- {7: CoGBK<string,int>/GW/CoGBK<bytes,int[varintz]>}] -> [Out: KV<string,int> -> {8: KV<string,int>/GW/KV<bytes,int[varintz]>}]
9: ParDo [In(Main): KV<string,int> <- {8: KV<string,int>/GW/KV<bytes,int[varintz]>}] -> [Out: string -> {9: string/GW/bytes}]
10: ParDo [In(Main): T <- {9: string/GW/bytes}] -> [Out: KV<int,T> -> {10: KV<int,string>/GW/KV<int[varintz],bytes>}]
11: CoGBK [In(Main): KV<int,string> <- {10: KV<int,string>/GW/KV<int[varintz],bytes>}] -> [Out: CoGBK<int,string> -> {11: CoGBK<int,string>/GW/CoGBK<int[varintz],bytes>}]
12: ParDo [In(Main): CoGBK<int,string> <- {11: CoGBK<int,string>/GW/CoGBK<int[varintz],bytes>}] -> []

2018/03/21 09:39:04 Writing to /tmp/result.txt
```

The debugging output is currently quite verbose and likely to change. The output is a local
file in this case:

```
$ head /tmp/result.txt
while: 2
darkling: 1
rail'd: 1
ford: 1
bleed's: 1
hath: 52
Remain: 1
disclaim: 1
sentence: 1
purse: 6
```

#### Run Example on the Dataflow Runner

Set variables specific to your [Google Cloud environment](#google-cloud-setup).

To run [examples/wordcount](examples/wordcount) on the [Dataflow Runner](#dataflow-runner) run the following. See
[pkg/beam/runners/dataflow/dataflow.go](pkg/beam/runners/dataflow/dataflow.go) and
[examples/wordcount/wordcount.go](examples/wordcount/wordcount.go) for a descriptions of required and optional flags.

```
go run go/examples/wordcount/wordcount.go --runner=dataflow --project=<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> --region=<YOUR_GCP_REGION> --staging_location=<YOUR_GCS_LOCATION>/staging --output=<YOUR_GCS_LOCATION>/output
```

The output is a GCS file in this case:

```
$ gsutil cat <YOUR_GCS_LOCATION>/output* | head
Blanket: 1
blot: 1
Kneeling: 3
cautions: 1
appears: 4
Deserved: 1
nettles: 1
OSWALD: 53
sport: 3
Crown'd: 1
```

## Testing

### Reminder on the Docker requirement

Above documents the [Docker requirement](#docker) and becomes relevant in this
[section](#using-a-cicd-replicated-environment)'s context, particularly for [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)
users.

#### 1. Navigate to the go.mod directory

Open a terminal and navigate into the go.mod containing directory of the Beam repository. (See above for what
`$BEAM_ROOT` means). Notice that you are entering the `$BEAM_ROOT/sdks` and not `$BEAM_ROOT/sdks/go`.

```sh
cd $BEAM_ROOT/sdks
```

#### 2. Run Go test

Run go test as you would any Go project.

For unit tests in the exported `pkg/beam` package:
```
go test ./go/pkg/beam...
```

For integration, load, and regression tests:
```
go test ./go/test/...
```

### Runner validations

The following documents various [Runner](#runner) validation tests related to test execution of the Go SDK
**in this repository** (in contrast to your own Go SDK dependent repository and projects).
You'll see some documentation that deviates from Go test execution convention to run gradle commands.

As a Go developer, you might ask yourself, "Why gradle instead of 'go test' ðŸ˜¬?"
Under the hood, various [Runner](#runner) architecture involves resources and non-Go languages that Go SDK runner
validations require. The cost of deviating from the `go test` convention, comes with the benefit of allowing you
as a Beam contributor to focus on the Go SDK and ignore the underlying architecture specifics. The gradle commands
conveniently automate and encapsulate these details.

#### 1. Navigate to the Beam root directory

Open a terminal and navigate into the root directory of the Beam repository. (See [Beam Repository](#beam-repository)
for what `$BEAM_ROOT` means).

```sh
cd $BEAM_ROOT
```

#### Execute tests

To execute tests that validate against the [Portable Python Runner](#portable-python-runner):

```
./gradlew :sdks:go:test:ulrValidatesRunner
```

To execute tests that validate against the [Flink Runner](#flink-runner)

```
./gradlew :sdks:go:test:flinkValidatesRunner
```

# Definitions

## Local Runner

A [Runner](#runner) that runs pipeline code on your local machine, in contrast to other runners such as
the [Dataflow Runner](#dataflow-runner)

## Dataflow Runner

A [Runner](#runner) that runs pipeline code on [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow).

## Flink Runner

A [Runner](#runner) that runs pipeline code on the [Flink Runner]()

## Portable Python Runner

A [Runner](#runner) that runs pipeline code using the
[Python Portable Runner](../python/apache_beam/runners/portability/portable_runner.py)

## Runner

A Runner runs your pipeline code. You write your pipeline using the Go programming language and execute on a Runner.
See [examples](#run-examples) for how this looks in practice using the `--runner` flag.
[https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix)
provides a list of available Beam Runners.

## Source

A resource from which you read data in a Beam pipeline. Examples include a file directory from which you read
files, a database from which you acquire data via a SQL query, or an API from which you consume response
payloads.

## Sink

A resource to which you write data in a Beam pipeline. Examples include a hard disk directory to which you create and
write file data, a database to which you insert or update records, or an API to which you post remote call payloads.
