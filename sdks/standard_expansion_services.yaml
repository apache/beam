# This file enumerates the standard Apache Beam expansion services.
# Each service must specify a package destination for each supported SDK, which
# is where generated wrappers will go by default.
#
# Individual transforms can modify their destination module as well as their
# generated wrapper class name.
#
# Transform identifiers listed in the `skip_transforms` field will be skipped.
#
#
# Any new gradle targets added here should also be added to:
# - sdks/python/build.gradle (as a dependency in the 'generateExternalTransformsConfig' task)
# - sdks/python/test-suites/xlang/build.gradle (look for 'servicesToGenerateFrom')
#
# After making changes here, please run `./gradlew generateExternalTransformsConfig`
# to regenerate the config file at sdks/standard_external_transforms.yaml
#
# Refer to sdks/python/gen_xlang_wrappers.py for more info.
