# GitHub Actions - Self-hosted Linux Runners
These folders contain the required resources to deploy the GitHub Actions self-hosted runners for the workflows running in Ubuntu OS.
* /docker
  * Dockerfile and entrypoint: Resources needed to create a new self-hosted-runner image.
  * docker-compose.yml: In case you would like to test and run the self-hosted runner locally.

* /kubernetes
  * Kubernetes files to create the resources needed to deploy the sel-hosted runners.

## Docker

#### How to build a new image and push it to the Artifact Registry?
* Create the image locally

`docker build -t $LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME:TAG .`

* Tag the local image with the GCP repository name

`docker tag $LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY/IMAGE:latest`

* Make sure you are authenticated to the gcloud repository

`gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev`

* Push the tagged image to the repository

`docker push LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY/IMAGE:latest`

#### How to run a self-hosted locally?

* Create a `.var.env` file from the `example.var.env` file and replace the corresponding values

* Run the container

`docker-compose up`

* You will be able to see the self-hosted runner in the Settings of your GitHub repository

## Kubernetes
* Configure your Kubernetes local context

`gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME --zone us-central1-a --project $PROJECT-ID`

* Update the `github-actions-secrets.yml` file with its corresponding encrypted in base64 values

`echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | base64`
`echo GITHUB_REPO | base64`

* Replace in `github-actions-deployment.yml` file the `$IMAGE_URL` variable with the corresponding image URL: `LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY/IMAGE`

* In case you would like to create the deployment from scratch, run the `run-k8s-deployment.sh` script to do the Kubernetes deployment in the GKE cluster. Make sure you have the GKE context selected in your local machine

`./run-k8s-deployment.sh`

* Otherwise, apply only the changes. Make sure you have the GKE context selected in your local machine

`kubectl apply -f github-actions-$FILE_NAME.yml`
