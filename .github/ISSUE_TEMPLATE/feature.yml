        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this feature request! Once you've created an issue, you can self-assign by commenting `.take-issue` and you can close by commenting `.close-issue`.
        Anyone can reopen a closed issue by commenting `.reopen-issue`.
        You can also add/remove labels by commenting `.add-labels label1,label2,'label 3 with spaces'` or `.remove-labels label1,label2,'label 3 with spaces'`,
        or with `.set-labels label1,label2,'label 3 with spaces'` (which removes any labels not in that set).
