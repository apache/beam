# This workflow modifies the GCP User Roles when the infra/users.yml file is updated.
# It applies the changes using Terraform to manage the IAM roles for users defined in the users.yml
# If the workflow is triggered by a pull request, it will post the Terraform plan as a comment on the PR
# as a code block for easy review.
