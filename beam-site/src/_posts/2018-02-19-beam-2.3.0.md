We are glad to present the new 2.3.0 release of Beam. This release includes
multiple fixes and new functionalities. <!--more--> For more information
please check the detailed release notes.

# New Features / Improvements

## Beam moves to Java 8

The supported version of Java for Beam is now Java 8. The code and examples have
been refactored to use multiple of the advantages of the language, e.g. lambdas,
streams, improved type inference, etc.

## Spark runner is now based on Spark 2.x

Spark runner moves forward into the Spark 2.x development line, this would allow
to benefit of improved performance, as well as open the runner for future
compatibility with the Structured Streaming APIs. Notice that support for Spark
1.x is finished with this release.

## Amazon Web Services S3 Filesystem support

Beam already supported AWS S3 via HadoopFileSystem, but this version brings a
native implementation with the corresponding performance advantages of the S3
filesystem.

## General-purpose writing to files

This release contains a new transform, FileIO.write() / writeDynamic() that
implements a general-purpose fluent and Java8-friendly API for writing to files
using a FileIO.Sink. This API has similar capabilities to DynamicDestinations
APIs from Beam 2.2 but is much easier to use and extend. The DynamicDestinations
APIs for writing to files are deprecated by it, as is FileBasedSink.

## Splittable DoFn support on the Python SDK

This release adds the Splittable DoFn API for Python SDK and adds Splittable
DoFn support for Python streaming DirectRunner.

## Portability

Progress continues to being able to execute Python on runners other then Google
Cloud Dataflow and the Go SDK on any runner.

# Miscellaneous Fixes

## SDKs

* MapElements and FlatMapElements support using side inputs using the new
  interface Contextful.Fn. For library authors, this interface is the
  recommended choice for user-code callbacks that may use side inputs.
* Introduces the family of Reify transforms for converting between explicit and
  implicit representations of various Beam entities.
* Introduces two transforms for approximate sketching of data: Count-Min Sketch
  (approximate element frequency estimation) and HyperLogLog (approximate
  cardinality estimation).

## Runners

* Staging files on Dataflow shows progress
* Flink runner is based now on Flink version 1.4.0

## IOs

* BigtableIO now supports ValueProvider configuration
* BigQueryIO supports writing bounded collections to tables with partition
  decorators
* KafkaIO moves to version 1.0 (it is still backwards compatible with versions >= 0.9.x.x)
* Added IO source for VCF files (Python)
* Added support for backoff on deadlocks in JdbcIO.write() and connection
  improvement
* Improved performance of KinesisIO.read()
* Many improvements to TikaIO
