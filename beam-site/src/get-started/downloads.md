# Apache Beam&#8482; Downloads

> Beam SDK {{ site.release_latest }} is the latest released version.

## Using a central repository

The easiest way to use Apache Beam is via one of the released versions in a
central repository. The Java SDK is available on [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache.beam%22),
and the Python SDK is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apache-beam).

For example, if you are developing using Maven and want to use the SDK for Java
with the `DirectRunner`, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
      <artifactId>beam-sdks-java-core</artifactId>
      <version>{{ site.release_latest }}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
      <artifactId>beam-runners-direct-java</artifactId>
      <version>{{ site.release_latest }}</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>

Similarly in Python, if you are using PyPI and want to use the SDK for Python
with `DirectRunner`, add the following requirement to your `setup.py` file:

    apache-beam=={{ site.release_latest }}

Additionally, you may want to depend on additional SDK modules, such as IO
connectors or other extensions, and additional runners to execute your pipeline
at scale.

## Downloading source code

You can download the source code package for a release from the links in the
[Releases](#releases) section.


## API stability

Apache Beam uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Version numbers use
the form `major.minor.incremental` and are incremented as follows:

* major version for incompatible API changes
* minor version for new functionality added in a backward-compatible manner
* incremental version for forward-compatible bug fixes

Please note that APIs marked [`@Experimental`]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/sdks/javadoc/{{ site.release_latest }}/org/apache/beam/sdk/annotations/Experimental.html)
may change at any point and are not guaranteed to remain compatible across versions.

Additionally, any API may change before the first stable release, i.e., between
versions denoted `0.x.y`.
