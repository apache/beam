# Website Contributions

Contributions to the website require the same steps as contributions to the
main repository, so start with the instructions for [Contributing
Code]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/contribution-guide).

The Beam website is in the [Beam Site GitHub
mirror](https://github.com/apache/beam-site) repository in the `asf-site`
branch (_not_ `master`).

Issues are tracked in the
[website](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM/component/12328906)
component in JIRA.

## One-time Setup

The [README file](https://github.com/apache/beam-site/blob/asf-site/README.md)
in the website repository has more information on how to set up the required
dependencies for your development environment.

The general guidelines for cloning a repository can be adjusted to use the
`asf-site` branch of `beam-site`:

	$ git clone -b asf-site https://github.com/apache/beam-site.git
	$ cd beam-site
	$ git remote add <GitHub_user> git@github.com:<GitHub_user>/beam-site.git
	$ git fetch --all
	$ git checkout -b <my-branch> origin/asf-site

## Working on your change

While you are working on your pull request, you can test and develop live by
running the following command in the root folder of the website:

	$ bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental

Jekyll will start a webserver on port 4000. As you make changes to the content,
Jekyll will rebuild it automatically.

In addition, you can run the tests to valid your links using:

	$ bundle exec rake test

Both of these commands will cause the `content/` directory to be generated.
Merging autogenerated content can get tricky, so please leave this directory
out of your commits and pull request by doing:

	$ git checkout -- content

When you are ready, submit a pull request using the [Beam Site GitHub
mirror](https://github.com/apache/beam-site), including the JIRA issue as
usual.

During review, committers will patch in your PR, generate the static
`content/`, and review the changes.

## Committing website changes (committers only)

We have a bot that runs tests and merges changes to the website.
When the pull request is fully ready to be merged, a committer
can comment

    @asfgit merge
