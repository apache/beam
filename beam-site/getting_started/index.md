The Apache Beam project is in the process of bootstrapping. This includes the creation of project resources, the refactoring of the initial code submission, and the formulation of project documentation, planning, and design documents. Until the project is fully initialized, this page contains useful resources to learn more about the model and tools which comprise Apache Beam.

## Current code
The following GitHub repositories contain code which will be incorporated into Apache Beam.

* [Dataflow Java SDK](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK)
* [Flink Dataflow runner](https://github.com/dataArtisans/flink-dataflow)
* [Spark Dataflow runner](https://github.com/cloudera/spark-dataflow)

These code repositories will be refactored and managed together (along with other code and new contributions) into a single repository.
