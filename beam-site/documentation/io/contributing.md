# Contributing I/O Transforms

* If you are planning to contribute your I/O transform to the Apache Beam community, you'll be going through the normal Beam contribution life cycle - see the [Apache Beam Contribution Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/contribution-guide/) for more details.
* Talk to the community!
* Make sure you've implemented the appropriate tests as discussed in the [Testing I/O Transforms]({{site.baseurl }}/documentation/io/testing/) section.

> Note: This guide is still in progress. There is an open issue to finish the guide: [BEAM-1025](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1025).
