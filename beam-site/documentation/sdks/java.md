# Apache Beam Java SDK

The Java SDK for Apache Beam provides a simple, powerful API for building both batch and streaming parallel data processing pipelines in Java.


## Get Started with the Java SDK

Get started with the [Beam Programming Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/programming-guide/) to learn the basic concepts that apply to all SDKs in Beam.

See the [Java API Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/sdks/javadoc/) for more information on individual APIs.


## Supported Features

The Java SDK supports all features currently supported by the Beam model.


## Pipeline I/O
See the [Beam-provided I/O Transforms]({{site.baseurl }}/documentation/io/built-in/) page for a list of the currently available I/O transforms.


## Extensions

The Java SDK has the following extensions:

- [join-library]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sdks/java-extensions/#join-library) provides inner join, outer left join, and outer right join functions.
- [sorter]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sdks/java-extensions/#sorter) is an efficient and scalable sorter for large iterables.
- [Nexmark]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sdks/nexmark) is a benchmark suite that runs in batch and streaming modes.
