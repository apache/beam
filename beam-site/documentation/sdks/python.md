# Apache Beam Python SDK

The Python SDK for Apache Beam provides a simple, powerful API for building batch data processing pipelines in Python.

## Get Started with the Python SDK

Get started with the [Beam Programming Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/programming-guide) to learn the basic concepts that apply to all SDKs in Beam.

Then, follow the [Beam Python SDK Quickstart]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/quickstart-py) to set up your Python development environment, get the Beam SDK for Python, and run an example pipeline.

## Python Type Safety

Python is a dynamically-typed language with no static type checking. The Beam SDK for Python uses type hints during pipeline construction and runtime to try to emulate the correctness guarantees achieved by true static typing. [Ensuring Python Type Safety]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/sdks/python-type-safety) walks through how to use type hints, which help you to catch potential bugs up front with the [Direct Runner]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/runners/direct/).
