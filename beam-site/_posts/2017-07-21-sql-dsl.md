BeamSQL provides the capability to execute standard SQL queries using Beam Java SDK. DSL interface packages the backend parsing/validation/assembling features, and delivers a SDK style API to developers, to express a processing logic using SQL statements, from simple TABLE_FILTER, to complex queries containing JOIN/GROUP_BY etc.

This page describes the implementation of Beam SQL, and how to simplify a Beam pipeline with DSL APIs.

# <a name="overview"></a>1. Overview
SQL is a well-adopted standard to process data with concise syntax. With DSL APIs, now `PCollection`s can be queried with standard SQL statements, like a regular table. The DSL APIs leverage [Apache Calcite](http://calcite.apache.org/) to parse and optimize SQL queries, then translate into a composite Beam `PTransform`. In this way, both SQL and normal Beam `PTransform`s can be mixed in the same pipeline.

# <a name="internal-of-sql"></a>2. The Internal of Beam SQL
Figure 1 describes the back-end steps from a SQL statement to a Beam `PTransform`.

![Workflow of Beam SQL DSL]({{ "/images/beam_sql_dsl_workflow.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }} "workflow of Beam SQL DSL")

**Figure 1** workflow of Beam SQL DSL

Given a `PCollection` and the query as input, first of all the input `PCollection` is registered as a table in the schema repository. Then it's processed as:

1. SQL query is parsed according to grammar to generate a SQL Abstract Syntax Tree;
2. Validate against table schema, and output a logical plan represented with relational algebras;
3. Relational rules are applied to convert it to a physical plan, expressed with Beam components. An optimizer is optional to update the plan;
4. Finally, the Beam physical plan is compiled as a composite `PTransform`;

Here is an example to show a query that filters and projects from an input `PCollection`:

```
SELECT USER_ID, USER_NAME FROM PCOLLECTION WHERE USER_ID = 1
```

The logical plan is shown as:

```
LogicalProject(USER_ID=[$0], USER_NAME=[$1])
  LogicalFilter(condition=[=($0, 1)])
    LogicalTableScan(table=[[PCOLLECTION]])
```

And compiled as a composite `PTransform`

```
pCollection.apply(BeamSqlFilter...)
           .apply(BeamSqlProject...)
```

# <a name="usage"></a>3. Usage of DSL APIs 
The DSL interface (`BeamSql.query()` and `BeamSql.simpleQuery()`), is the only endpoint exposed to developers. It wraps the back-end details of parsing/validation/assembling, to deliver a Beam SDK style API that can take either simple TABLE_FILTER queries or complex queries containing JOIN/GROUP_BY etc. 

*Note*, the two APIs are equivalent in functionality, `BeamSql.query()` applies on a `PCollectionTuple` with one or many input `PCollection`s, and `BeamSql.simpleQuery()` is a simplified API which applies on single `PCollection`.

[BeamSqlExample](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/DSL_SQL/dsls/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/dsls/sql/example/BeamSqlExample.java) in code repository shows the usage of both APIs:

```
//Step 1. create a source PCollection with Create.of();
PCollection<BeamSqlRow> inputTable = PBegin.in(p).apply(Create.of(row)
    .withCoder(new BeamSqlRowCoder(type)));

//Step 2. (Case 1) run a simple SQL query over input PCollection with BeamSql.simpleQuery;
PCollection<BeamSqlRow> outputStream = inputTable.apply(
    BeamSql.simpleQuery("select c2, c3 from PCOLLECTION where c1=1"));


//Step 2. (Case 2) run the query with BeamSql.query
PCollection<BeamSqlRow> outputStream2 =
    PCollectionTuple.of(new TupleTag<BeamSqlRow>("TABLE_B"), inputTable)
        .apply(BeamSql.query("select c2, c3 from TABLE_B where c1=1"));
```

In Step 1, a `PCollection<BeamSqlRow>` is prepared as the source dataset. The work to generate a queriable `PCollection<BeamSqlRow>` is beyond the scope of Beam SQL DSL. 

Step 2(Case 1) shows the way to run a query with `BeamSql.simpleQuery()`, be aware that the input `PCollection` is named with a fixed table name __PCOLLECTION__. Step 2(Case 2) is an example to run a query with `BeamSql.query()`. A Table name used in the query is specified when adding `PCollection` to `PCollectionTuple`. As each call of either `BeamSql.query()` or `BeamSql.simpleQuery()` has its own schema repository, developers need to include all `PCollection`s that would be used in your query.

# <a name="functionality"></a>4. Functionality in Beam SQL
Just as the unified model for both bounded and unbounded data in Beam, SQL DSL provides the same functionalities for bounded and unbounded `PCollection` as well. 

Note that, SQL support is not fully completed. Queries that include unsupported features would cause a UnsupportedOperationException.

## <a name="features"></a>4.1. Supported Features
The following features are supported in current repository (this chapter will be updated continually).

**1. filter clauses;**

**2. data field projections;**

**3. aggregations;**

Beam SQL supports aggregation functions COUNT/SUM/MAX/MIN/AVG with group_by in global_window, fixed_window, sliding_window and session_window. A field with type `TIMESTAMP` is required to specify fixed_window/sliding_window/session window, which is used as event timestamp for rows. See below for several examples:

```
//fixed window, one hour in duration
SELECT f_int, COUNT(*) AS `size` FROM PCOLLECTION GROUP BY f_int, TUMBLE(f_timestamp, INTERVAL '1' HOUR)

//sliding window, one hour in duration and 30 minutes period
SELECT f_int, COUNT(*) AS `size` FROM PCOLLECTION GROUP BY f_int, HOP(f_timestamp, INTERVAL '1' HOUR, INTERVAL '30' MINUTE)

//session window, with 5 minutes gap duration
SELECT f_int, COUNT(*) AS `size` FROM PCOLLECTION GROUP BY f_int, SESSION(f_timestamp, INTERVAL '5' MINUTE)
```

Note: 

1. distinct aggregation is not supported yet.
2. the default trigger is `Repeatedly.forever(AfterWatermark.pastEndOfWindow())`;
3. when `time` field in `HOP(dateTime, slide, size [, time ])`/`TUMBLE(dateTime, interval [, time ])`/`SESSION(dateTime, interval [, time ])` is specified, a lateFiring trigger is added as 

```
Repeatedly.forever(AfterWatermark.pastEndOfWindow().withLateFirings(AfterProcessingTime
        .pastFirstElementInPane().plusDelayOf(Duration.millis(delayTime.getTimeInMillis()))));
```		

**4. Join (inner, left_outer, right_outer);**

The scenarios of join can be categorized into 3 cases:

1. BoundedTable JOIN BoundedTable
2. UnboundedTable JOIN UnboundedTable
3. BoundedTable JOIN UnboundedTable

For case 1 and case 2, a standard join is utilized as long as the windowFn of the both sides match. For case 3, sideInput is utilized to implement the join. So there are some constraints:

* Only equal-join is supported, CROSS JOIN is not supported;
* FULL OUTER JOIN is not supported;
* If it's a LEFT OUTER JOIN, the unbounded table should on the left side; If it's a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, the unbounded table should on the right side;
* The trigger is inherented from upstream, which should be consistent;

**5. built-in SQL functions**

**6. User Defined Function (UDF) and User Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF);**

If the required function is not available, developers can register their own UDF(for scalar function) and UDAF(for aggregation function).

**create and specify User Defined Function (UDF)**

A UDF can be any Java method that takes zero or more scalar fields, and return one scalar value. Below is an example of UDF and how to use it in DSL:

```
/**
 * A example UDF for test.
 */
public static class CubicInteger implements BeamSqlUdf{
  public static Integer eval(Integer input){
    return input * input * input;
  }
}

// register and call in SQL
String sql = "SELECT f_int, cubic(f_int) as cubicvalue FROM PCOLLECTION WHERE f_int = 2";
PCollection<BeamSqlRow> result =
    input.apply("udfExample",
        BeamSql.simpleQuery(sql).withUdf("cubic", CubicInteger.class));
```

**create and specify User Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF)**

A UDAF aggregates a set of grouped scalar values, and output a single scalar value. To create a UDAF function, it's required to extend `org.apache.beam.dsls.sql.schema.BeamSqlUdaf<InputT, AccumT, OutputT>`, which defines 4 methods to process an aggregation:

1. init(), to create an initial accumulate value;
2. add(), to apply a new value to existing accumulate value;
3. merge(), to merge accumulate values from parallel operators;
4. result(), to generate the final result from accumulate value;

Here's an example of UDAF:

```
/**
 * UDAF for test, which returns the sum of square.
 */
public static class SquareSum extends BeamSqlUdaf<Integer, Integer, Integer> {
  public SquareSum() {
  }
  
  @Override
  public Integer init() {
    return 0;
  }
  
  @Override
  public Integer add(Integer accumulator, Integer input) {
    return accumulator + input * input;
  }
  
  @Override
  public Integer merge(Iterable<Integer> accumulators) {
    int v = 0;
    Iterator<Integer> ite = accumulators.iterator();
    while (ite.hasNext()) {
      v += ite.next();
    }
    return v;
  }

  @Override
  public Integer result(Integer accumulator) {
    return accumulator;
  }
}

//register and call in SQL
String sql = "SELECT f_int1, squaresum(f_int2) AS `squaresum` FROM PCOLLECTION GROUP BY f_int2";
PCollection<BeamSqlRow> result =
    input.apply("udafExample",
        BeamSql.simpleQuery(sql).withUdaf("squaresum", SquareSum.class));
```
 
## <a name="beamsqlrow"></a>4.2. Intro of BeamSqlRow
`BeamSqlRow`, encoded/decoded by `BeamSqlRowCoder`, represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a Beam SQL compatible `PCollection`. Similar as _row_ in the context of relational database, each `BeamSqlRow` consists of named columns with fixed types(see [4.3. Data Types](#data-type)).

A Beam SQL `PCollection` can be created from an external source, in-memory data or derive from another SQL query. For `PCollection`s from external source or in-memory data, it's required to specify coder explcitly; `PCollection` derived from SQL query has the coder set already. Below is one example:

```
//define the input row format
List<String> fieldNames = Arrays.asList("c1", "c2", "c3");
List<Integer> fieldTypes = Arrays.asList(Types.INTEGER, Types.VARCHAR, Types.DOUBLE);
BeamSqlRecordType type = BeamSqlRecordType.create(fieldNames, fieldTypes);
BeamSqlRow row = new BeamSqlRow(type);
row.addField(0, 1);
row.addField(1, "row");
row.addField(2, 1.0);

//create a source PCollection with Create.of();
PCollection<BeamSqlRow> inputTable = PBegin.in(p).apply(Create.of(row)
    .withCoder(new BeamSqlRowCoder(type)));
```
