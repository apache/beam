# Overview

This directory holds code and related artifacts to support API related
integration tests.

## System review

The diagram below summarizes the system design. Integration tests use an API
client that makes calls to a backend service. Prior to fulfilling the response,
the service checks and decrements a quota. Said quota persists in a backend
redis instance that is refreshed on an interval by the
[Refresher](./src/main/go/cmd/service/refresher).

## Echo Service

The [Echo Service](./src/main/go/cmd/service/echo) implements a simple gRPC
service that echos a payload. See [echo.proto](./proto/echo/v1/echo.proto)
for details.

# Testing

## Unit

To run unit tests in this project, execute the following command:

```
go test ./src/main/go/internal/...
```

## Integration

TODO: See https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/28859

# Local Usage

## Requirements

To execute the services on your local machine, you'll need [redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

## Execute services

Follow these steps to run the services on your local machine.


1. Start redis

    Start redis using the following command.
    ```
    redis-server
    ```

1. Start the refresher service in a new terminal.
    ```
    export CACHE_HOST=localhost:6379; \
    export QUOTA_ID=$(uuidgen); \
    export QUOTA_REFRESH_INTERVAL=10s; \
    export QUOTA_SIZE=100; \
    go run ./src/main/go/cmd/service/refresher
    ```
1. Start the echo service in a new terminal.
    ```
    export HTTP_PORT=8080; \
    export GRPC_PORT=50051; \
    export CACHE_HOST=localhost:6379; \
    go run ./src/main/go/cmd/service/echo
    ```
