# This file is a pkb benchmark configuration file, used when running the IO ITs
# that use this data store. It allows users to run tests when they are on a
# separate network from the kubernetes cluster by reading the hadoop namenode IP
# address from the LoadBalancer service.
#
# When running Perfkit with DirectRunner - format pattern must additionally contain
# dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname set to true:
#   format: '[{\"fs.defaultFS\":\"hdfs://{{LoadBalancerIp}}:9000\",\"dfs.replication\":1,\"dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname\":\"true\" }]'
# and /etc/hosts should be modified with an entries containing:
#   LoadBalancerIp HadoopMasterPodName
#   LoadBalancerIp FQDN-HadoopDatanode-0
#   LoadBalancerIp FQDN-HadoopDatanode-1
#   LoadBalancerIp FQDN-HadoopDatanode-2
# otherwise hdfs client won't be able to reach datanodes. Proper configuration to add
# will be generated when setup-all.sh script will be used to create cluster.
# FilenamePrefix is used in file-based-io-tests.
