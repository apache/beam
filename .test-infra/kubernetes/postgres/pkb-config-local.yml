# This file is a pkb benchmark configuration file, used when running the IO ITs
# that use this data store. It allows users to run tests when they are on a
# separate network from the kubernetes cluster by reading the postgres IP
# address from the LoadBalancer service.
#
# This file defines pipeline options to pass to beam, as well as how to derive
# the values for those pipeline options from kubernetes (where appropriate.)
